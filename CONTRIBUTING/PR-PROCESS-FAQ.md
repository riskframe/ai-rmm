# Submitting Pull Requests to AI-RMM

**Q1: How do I submit a Pull Request (PR) with suggested changes or updates to AI-RMM?**

**A1:** To submit a PR, first fork the AI-RMM repository to your own GitHub account. Then, make your changes or updates in your forked copy. Once you're ready, navigate to the original AI-RMM repository and click on the 'New pull request' button. Choose your fork as the "compare" branch and ensure the base repository is set to AI-RMM. Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes and submit the PR.

**Q2: What happens after I submit a PR to AI-RMM?**

**A2:** After you submit a PR, it enters the review process. Community managers and other contributors will review your suggested changes. This review process might involve discussions, suggestions for modifications, or requests for additional information. It's a collaborative process aimed at ensuring that contributions align with the project's goals and standards.

**Q3: How long does it take for a PR to be reviewed?**

**A3:** The review time can vary depending on the complexity of the changes and the availability of community managers and reviewers. We aim to review PRs as promptly as possible, but it might take a few days to a few weeks. We appreciate your patience during this process.

**Q4: What are the possible outcomes of my PR review?**

**A4:** Your PR can have one of the following outcomes:

- Approved: Your changes meet the project's standards and guidelines, and they will be merged into the project.
- Request for Changes: Your PR has potential but requires modifications. Reviewers will provide feedback, and you'll be asked to make updates accordingly.
- Rejected: On rare occasions, a PR might be rejected if it doesn't align with the project's direction, goals, or standards. Feedback will be provided to explain the decision.

**Q5: What should I do if my PR requires further work?**

**A5:** If your PR requires further work, review the feedback provided by the community managers and other contributors. Make the necessary adjustments to your proposed changes and update your PR. Communication is key during this process, so feel free to ask questions or seek clarification if needed.

**Q6: Can I resubmit a PR if it was rejected?**

**A6:** Yes, you can resubmit a PR after a rejection. We recommend thoroughly reviewing the feedback provided, making significant revisions to address the concerns raised, and ensuring your resubmitted PR aligns closely with the project's objectives and guidelines.

**Q7: Who can I contact if I have questions about the PR process or need guidance?**

**A7:** If you have questions or need guidance, feel free to open an issue in the AI-RMM repository with your query, or reach out directly to the community managers or contributors who have been involved in the review of your PR.
