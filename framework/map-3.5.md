## Map 3.5: Processes for human oversight are defined, assessed, and documented in accordance with organizational policies from the govern function.

### Map 3.5.1. Establish Human Oversight Roles and Responsibilities.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of human operators and other oversight personnel involved in the AI system's lifecycle.

2. Categorize oversight roles based on the level of involvement in decision-making, such as approving AI outputs, addressing potential biases, and initiating system interventions.

3. Document the roles and responsibilities matrix, ensuring it aligns with organizational policies and guidelines.

### Map 3.5.2. Implement Procedures for Human Oversight Activities.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop comprehensive procedures for human oversight activities, including data monitoring, AI system auditing, and review of AI outputs.

2. Define the triggers for human intervention, such as anomalous patterns, potential biases, or deviation from expected behavior.

3. Document the oversight procedures in detail, including checklists, templates, and decision-making frameworks.

### Map 3.5.3. Integrate Human Oversight into System Architecture.

#### Sub Practices

1. Design the AI system's architecture to facilitate human oversight by providing mechanisms for real-time monitoring, auditing, and intervention.

2. Develop interfaces that enable human operators to access relevant data, logs, and AI outputs.

3. Implement mechanisms for logging and tracking human oversight activities for auditing and accountability purposes.

### Map 3.5.4. Integrate Human Oversight into Training and Development.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate human oversight training into the training programs for AI operators and practitioners.

2. Provide training on the purpose, principles, and procedures of human oversight, including data analysis, bias detection, and risk assessment.

3. Develop hands-on training exercises and simulations to familiarize operators with real-world scenarios and decision-making processes.

### Map 3.5.5. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Oversight Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and evaluate the effectiveness of human oversight mechanisms to ensure they are adequately addressing potential risks and promoting responsible AI practices.

2. Gather feedback from human operators, stakeholders, and regulators to identify areas for improvement.

3. Adapt oversight procedures, training programs, and system architecture as needed to maintain a robust human oversight framework.
