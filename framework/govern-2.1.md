### Govern 2.1.1. Define and Document Roles and Responsibilities.

Defining and documenting roles and responsibilities within the organization is essential to ensure clarity and accountability in mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks. This involves identifying key individuals and teams involved in various aspects of AI risk management, outlining their specific duties and obligations, and establishing clear lines of communication and reporting structures. By documenting these roles and responsibilities, all stakeholders throughout the organization can understand their contributions to AI risk management efforts, fostering a culture of accountability and collaboration.

Implementing a comprehensive RACI matrix is essential to define and document roles and responsibilities for AI risk management across the organization. By assigning ownership to individuals or teams for specific activities and ensuring clear delineation of responsibilities, the organization can foster accountability and streamline communication. This structured approach ensures that everyone understands their roles in mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks, facilitating effective collaboration and decision-making throughout the organization.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for AI risk management across the organization.

2. Assign ownership to individuals or teams for specific AI risk management activities.

3. Document the roles and responsibilities in a comprehensive RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).

### Govern 2.1.2. Establish Communication Channels.

Clear communication channels is vital for effective AI risk management. This involves creating formal channels such as regular meetings, reporting mechanisms, and dedicated communication platforms where relevant teams and individuals can discuss AI risks, share insights, and raise concerns. Additionally, implementing an open-door policy and providing multiple avenues for communication encourages transparency and ensures that information flows freely across departments and hierarchical levels. By facilitating clear and open communication, organizations can enhance collaboration, identify risks proactively, and respond promptly to emerging challenges in AI deployment and usage.

Establish dedicated communication channels for AI risk management to facilitate effective information sharing and collaboration across the organization. Define clear protocols for escalating AI risk-related concerns and ensure accessibility of communication channels to all relevant individuals and teams. This fosters transparency, timely risk identification, and swift response to emerging challenges in AI deployment and usage.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create dedicated channels for communication related to AI risk management.

2. Define protocols for escalation of AI risk-related concerns.

3. Ensure that communication channels are accessible to all relevant individuals and teams.

### Govern 2.1.3. Implement Training and Awareness Programs

Implementing comprehensive training and awareness programs is essential to ensure that individuals and teams across the organization are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills for effectively mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks. These programs should cover topics such as AI ethics, risk assessment methodologies, data governance principles, and compliance requirements. By enhancing awareness and providing relevant training, organizations can empower their employees to proactively identify and address AI-related risks, thereby strengthening the overall risk management framework and promoting a culture of responsible AI deployment.

Establishing comprehensive training and awareness initiatives is crucial for ensuring that individuals and teams understand their responsibilities in AI risk management. These programs should include educational sessions to inform employees about their roles and the organization's AI risk management strategies. By regularly updating these programs, organizations can keep pace with the evolving landscape of AI risks, empowering their workforce to effectively contribute to risk mitigation efforts and maintain a culture of vigilance and accountability.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop training programs to educate individuals on their AI risk management responsibilities.

2. Provide awareness sessions to inform the organization about AI risk management initiatives.

3. Ensure that training and awareness programs are regularly updated to reflect evolving AI risk landscapes.
