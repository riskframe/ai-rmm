## Measure 2.9: The AI model is explained, validated, and documented, and AI system output is interpreted within its context – as identified in the map function – to inform responsible use and governance.

### Measure 2.9.1. Explain the AI Model.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement explainability techniques to provide clear and understandable explanations for the AI model's decisions and outputs.

2. Consider utilizing techniques such as feature importance, decision trees, and sensitivity analysis to explain the model's reasoning.

3. Document explainability methods and rationale, ensuring that explanations are accessible to users and interpretable in the context of the AI system's application.

### Measure 2.9.2. Validate the AI Model.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct rigorous validation activities to ensure the AI model's trustworthiness and reliability.

2. Evaluate the model's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and generalizability across a variety of data sets and scenarios.

3. Document validation results, including the model's performance metrics, limitations, and potential areas for improvement.

### Measure 2.9.3. Document the AI System and Its Outputs.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain a comprehensive record of the AI system's architecture, algorithms, data sources, and training processes.

2. Document the AI system's outputs, including decision logs, predictions, and recommendations.

3. Maintain a version history of the AI system and its documentation to track changes and maintain traceability.

### Measure 2.9.4. Interpret AI System Output within Context.

#### Sub Practices

1. Provide context-sensitive explanations and interpretations of the AI system's outputs to help users understand and interpret the results.

2. Consider factors such as data quality, user needs, and the specific context of the AI system's application.

3. Train users and decision-makers on how to interpret AI system outputs and make informed decisions based on the information provided.

### Measure 2.9.5. Integrate Explainability and Validation into Decision-Making Processes.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate explainability and validation findings into decision-making processes to inform responsible use and governance of the AI system.

2. Utilize explainability results to identify potential biases or limitations in the model's decision-making.

3. Employ validation results to assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Measure 2.9.6. Continuously Evaluate and Improve Explainability and Validation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of explainability and validation techniques, identifying areas for improvement and adapting approaches as the AI system evolves.

2. Gather feedback from users, operators, and stakeholders to refine explainability and validation practices.

3. Stay informed about emerging best practices and advancements in explainability and validation techniques for AI models.

### Measure 2.9.7. Promote Explainability and Validation Culture.

#### Sub Practices

1. Foster a culture of explainability and validation throughout the AI development lifecycle, emphasizing the importance of understanding and justifying AI decisions.

2. Educate and train AI developers, operators, and decision-makers on explainability and validation principles and best practices.

3. Integrate explainability and validation considerations into organizational policies, procedures, and governance frameworks.
