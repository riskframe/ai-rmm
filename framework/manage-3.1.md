### Manage 3.1.4. Implement Data Governance and Privacy Controls.

Implementing data governance and privacy controls is essential for managing AI risks and benefits associated with third-party resources. This involves establishing robust policies and procedures for data handling, storage, and usage, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards. Additionally, mechanisms such as data anonymization, encryption, and access controls should be implemented to safeguard sensitive information. Regular audits and assessments should be conducted to verify compliance and address any potential gaps in data governance and privacy practices, thereby mitigating risks and maintaining trust in third-party AI resources.

Incorporating data privacy regulations and organizational policies is crucial in managing data exchanged with third-party AI providers. This involves enforcing data access protocols, employing encryption methods, and applying anonymization techniques to safeguard sensitive information. Secure data sharing agreements should be established, outlining authorized usage and data retention periods, ensuring compliance and confidentiality throughout the data exchange process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Ensure that data exchanged with third-party AI providers complies with data privacy regulations and organizational data governance policies.

2. Establish data access protocols, encryption mechanisms, and anonymization techniques to protect sensitive information.

3. Implement secure data sharing agreements that specify authorized usage and data retention periods.

### Manage 3.1.5. Employ Risk Mitigation Strategies.
