# Map 2: Categorization of the AI system is performed.

## Map 2.1: The specific tasks and methods used to implement the tasks that the AI system will support are defined (e.g., classifiers, generative models, recommenders).

### Map 2.1.1. Define the Specific Tasks and Use Cases.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly articulate the specific tasks that the AI system will be designed to perform.

2. Describe the intended use cases for the AI system, including the target user groups and the desired outcomes.

3. Document the functional requirements for each task and use case to ensure alignment with system requirements.

### Map 2.1.2. Select Appropriate AI Techniques and Methods.

#### Sub Practices

1. Research and evaluate a range of AI techniques and methods that can be used to fulfill the defined tasks and use cases.

2. Consider the suitability of various AI algorithms, such as classifiers, generative models, recommender systems, and natural language processing (NLP) models.

3. Evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of each technique in terms of accuracy, efficiency, fairness, and interpretability.

### Map 2.1.3. Develop Technical Specifications.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create detailed technical specifications that outline the specific AI techniques, algorithms, and frameworks to be used for each task and use case.

2. Specify the data inputs, processing steps, and output formats for each AI component.

3. Consider the computational resources, storage requirements, and performance expectations for the AI system.

### Map 2.1.4. Document AI Technique Selection and Design.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that clearly explains the rationale for selecting specific AI techniques and methods.

2. Describe the design choices made for each AI component, including the data preprocessing steps, model training parameters, and hyperparameter optimization.

3. Document the limitations and assumptions associated with the chosen AI techniques.

### Map 2.1.5. Integrate AI Techniques into System Design.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate the selected AI techniques into the overall system design, ensuring that they align with the overall system architecture and requirements.

2. Address potential data compatibility issues, data quality concerns, and the interaction between AI components and other system elements.

3. Conduct simulations or prototypes to test the integration of AI components into the system and identify any potential issues or challenges.
