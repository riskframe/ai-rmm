## Map 1.6: System requirements (e.g., “the system shall respect the privacy of its users”) are elicited from and understood by relevant AI actors. Design decisions take socio-technical implications into account to address AI risks.

### Map 1.6.1. Elicit System Requirements from Relevant AI Actors.

#### Sub Practices

1. Engage a diverse team of AI actors, including developers, domain experts, users, and stakeholders, in the process of eliciting system requirements.

2. Encourage open communication and collaboration to capture a wide range of perspectives and ensure that requirements are comprehensive.

3. Document requirements clearly and concisely, using a structured format that facilitates understanding and traceability.

### Map 1.6.2. Prioritize Socio-Technical Implications in Design Decisions.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate a socio-technical lens into the AI design process, considering the social, cultural, and ethical implications of AI systems.

2. Conduct user research and stakeholder engagement to understand potential impacts on individuals, communities, and society.

3. Identify and address potential biases, fairness issues, and ethical concerns early in the design phase.

### Map 1.6.3. Address AI Risks through Design Decisions.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop design solutions that proactively mitigate AI risks, such as data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and unintended consequences.

2. Implement safeguards to protect user privacy, ensure transparency and explainability of AI models, and promote responsible AI practices.

3. Evaluate design decisions against the organization's risk tolerances and ethical framework.

### Map 1.6.4. Document Socio-Technical Considerations and Design Trade-offs.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that clearly outlines the socio-technical considerations that informed design decisions.

2. Explain the reasoning behind design trade-offs, balancing the need for functionality with ethical considerations and the mitigation of AI risks.

3. Share documentation with relevant stakeholders to promote transparency and accountability in the AI development process.

### Map 1.6.5. Continuously Evaluate and Refine System Requirements.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and update system requirements as the AI project progresses and new information becomes available.

2. Incorporate feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned from prototype testing or pilot deployments.

3. Maintain a living document that reflects the evolving requirements and design decisions throughout the AI lifecycle.
