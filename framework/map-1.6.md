## Map 1.6: System requirements (e.g., “the system shall respect the privacy of its users”) are elicited from and understood by relevant AI actors. Design decisions take socio-technical implications into account to address AI risks.

### Map 1.6.1. Elicit System Requirements from Relevant AI Actors.

To effectively elicit system requirements from relevant AI actors, organizations should engage in comprehensive communication and collaboration processes. This involves soliciting input from various stakeholders, including AI developers, end-users, domain experts, and regulatory authorities. By fostering open dialogue and incorporating diverse perspectives, organizations can gain a holistic understanding of system requirements, including functional needs, ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and regulatory requirements. This collaborative approach ensures that AI systems are designed to meet the needs and expectations of all stakeholders while addressing socio-technical implications and mitigating AI risks effectively.

Involving a diverse team of AI actors, including developers, domain experts, users, and stakeholders, is essential in eliciting system requirements effectively. Encouraging open communication and collaboration ensures that a wide range of perspectives is captured, facilitating the creation of comprehensive requirements. Clear and concise documentation of requirements, using a structured format, further enhances understanding and traceability throughout the development process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Engage a diverse team of AI actors, including developers, domain experts, users, and stakeholders, in the process of eliciting system requirements.

2. Encourage open communication and collaboration to capture a wide range of perspectives and ensure that requirements are comprehensive.

3. Document requirements clearly and concisely, using a structured format that facilitates understanding and traceability.

### Map 1.6.2. Prioritize Socio-Technical Implications in Design Decisions.

To effectively address AI risks, prioritize socio-technical implications in design decisions, ensuring that both technical and social aspects are considered throughout the development process. This involves evaluating how design choices impact not only the system's functionality and performance but also its ethical, legal, and societal implications. By placing importance on socio-technical considerations, developers can mitigate potential risks related to bias, fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability, ultimately fostering trust and acceptance of AI systems among users and stakeholders.

By integrating a socio-technical perspective into AI design, practitioners ensure that social, cultural, and ethical implications are thoroughly considered throughout the process. This involves conducting user research and engaging stakeholders to grasp potential impacts on individuals and society while identifying and addressing biases, fairness issues, and ethical concerns early on in the design phase.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate a socio-technical lens into the AI design process, considering the social, cultural, and ethical implications of AI systems.

2. Conduct user research and stakeholder engagement to understand potential impacts on individuals, communities, and society.

3. Identify and address potential biases, fairness issues, and ethical concerns early in the design phase.

### Map 1.6.3. Address AI Risks through Design Decisions.

To address AI risks through design decisions, it's crucial to incorporate risk mitigation strategies directly into the design process. This involves proactively identifying potential risks associated with the AI system's functionality, data handling, and interaction with users and stakeholders. By integrating risk assessment into design decisions, such as algorithm selection, model training methodologies, and user interface design, practitioners can mitigate risks related to bias, privacy violations, security vulnerabilities, and ethical considerations from the outset, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of the AI system.

Incorporating risk mitigation strategies directly into the design process is essential for addressing AI risks. This involves developing design solutions that proactively mitigate potential issues such as data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and unintended consequences. Implementing safeguards to protect user privacy, ensure transparency and explainability of AI models, and promote responsible AI practices is also crucial. Moreover, evaluating design decisions against the organization's risk tolerances and ethical framework helps ensure alignment with overarching goals and values.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop design solutions that proactively mitigate AI risks, such as data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and unintended consequences.

2. Implement safeguards to protect user privacy, ensure transparency and explainability of AI models, and promote responsible AI practices.

3. Evaluate design decisions against the organization's risk tolerances and ethical framework.

### Map 1.6.4. Document Socio-Technical Considerations and Design Trade-offs.

Documenting socio-technical considerations and design trade-offs is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability throughout the AI development process. It involves recording the various factors influencing design decisions, including social, cultural, ethical, and technical aspects, as well as the compromises made to address competing priorities or constraints. By documenting these considerations and trade-offs, stakeholders can better understand the rationale behind design choices and evaluate their implications on AI system behavior and societal impact.

Creating comprehensive documentation that clearly outlines the socio-technical considerations informing design decisions is crucial. This includes explaining the reasoning behind design trade-offs, balancing the need for functionality with ethical considerations and the mitigation of AI risks. Sharing this documentation with relevant stakeholders promotes transparency and accountability in the AI development process, fostering understanding and trust among all involved parties.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that clearly outlines the socio-technical considerations that informed design decisions.

2. Explain the reasoning behind design trade-offs, balancing the need for functionality with ethical considerations and the mitigation of AI risks.

3. Share documentation with relevant stakeholders to promote transparency and accountability in the AI development process.

### Map 1.6.5. Continuously Evaluate and Refine System Requirements.

Continuously evaluate and refine system requirements to ensure they remain aligned with evolving business needs, technological advancements, and societal expectations. This involves actively soliciting feedback from relevant AI actors and stakeholders, such as users, developers, and domain experts, to identify areas for improvement and address emerging risks. By regularly reassessing system requirements, organizations can adapt to changing contexts and better mitigate potential AI-related challenges.

Regularly reviewing and updating system requirements ensures that they remain relevant and responsive to changing project dynamics and stakeholder needs. Incorporating feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned from prototype testing or pilot deployments enables continuous improvement and refinement of requirements. By maintaining a living document that reflects evolving requirements and design decisions, organizations can enhance the agility and adaptability of their AI projects, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and update system requirements as the AI project progresses and new information becomes available.

2. Incorporate feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned from prototype testing or pilot deployments.

3. Maintain a living document that reflects the evolving requirements and design decisions throughout the AI lifecycle.
