## Manage 2.3: Procedures are followed to respond to and recover from a previously unknown risk when it is identified.

### Manage 2.3.1. Establish Incident Response Plan.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan to address unknown risks or unexpected events that may impact AI systems.

2. The plan should outline the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, communication protocols, and procedures for containment, mitigation, and recovery.

3. Regularly test and update the incident response plan to ensure its effectiveness and adaptability to new risks.

### Manage 2.3.2. Establish Rapid Detection Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms to identify and detect anomalies, deviations, or potential risks in AI systems.

2. Leverage anomaly detection techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data analytics tools to proactively identify potential issues.

3. Establish clear escalation procedures to ensure that detected incidents are promptly escalated to the appropriate parties for investigation and response.

### Manage 2.3.3. Conduct Root Cause Analysis.

#### Sub Practices

1. For any identified unknown risks or incidents, conduct a thorough root cause analysis to identify the underlying causes and contributing factors.

2. Utilize data analysis, investigative techniques, and expert consultation to uncover the root causes of the issue.

3. Document the root cause analysis findings to inform corrective actions and prevent recurrence.

### Manage 2.3.4. Implement Corrective and Preventive Actions.

#### Sub Practices

1. Based on the root cause analysis, develop and implement corrective actions to address the identified risks or incidents.

2. Take immediate steps to mitigate the impact of the risk or incident and restore system functionality.

3. Implement preventive actions to prevent similar risks or incidents from occurring in the future.

### Manage 2.3.5. Maintain Transparency and Communication.

#### Sub Practices

1. Provide timely and transparent communication to stakeholders regarding identified unknown risks, incident detection, and ongoing response activities.

2. Keep stakeholders informed about the status of investigations, corrective actions taken, and preventive measures implemented.

3. Address stakeholder concerns and questions promptly and effectively.

### Manage 2.3.6. Continuously Review and Improve.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and evaluate the effectiveness of risk response procedures and incident response plans.

2. Identify areas for improvement and refine procedures based on lessons learned from past incidents and emerging risks.

3. Foster a culture of continuous improvement and adaptability to ensure that AI systems are resilient to unforeseen risks and challenges.
