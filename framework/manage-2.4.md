### Manage 2.4.3. Establish Clear Disengagement Criteria.

Establishing clear disengagement criteria is crucial to effectively manage AI systems that exhibit performance or outcomes inconsistent with intended use. These criteria should outline specific conditions or thresholds that trigger the disengagement, such as significant deviations from expected performance metrics, ethical breaches, or legal violations. By defining these criteria upfront, organizations can ensure consistency and transparency in decision-making processes related to disengagement or deactivation. Additionally, clear criteria empower stakeholders to take prompt and appropriate actions when necessary, safeguarding against potential risks and mitigating negative impacts on users and stakeholders.

Defining clear and objective criteria for determining when to disengage or deactivate an AI system due to performance or outcome inconsistencies is essential. These criteria should be comprehensive, considering factors such as the severity and potential impact of the issue, the feasibility of mitigation measures, and the overall risk to stakeholders. Regularly reviewing and refining the disengagement criteria is crucial to ensure their effectiveness and relevance in addressing evolving risk profiles and technological advancements.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define clear and objective criteria for determining when to disengage or deactivate an AI system due to performance or outcome inconsistencies.

2. These criteria should consider factors such as the severity and potential impact of the issue, the feasibility of mitigation measures, and the overall risk to stakeholders.

3. Regularly review and refine the disengagement criteria to reflect evolving risk profiles and technological advancements.

### Manage 2.4.4. Assign Disengagement and Deactivation Responsibilities.

To ensure effective management of AI systems, it's imperative to assign clear responsibilities for disengagement and deactivation. This involves identifying key stakeholders and defining their roles in the disengagement process, including decision-makers, technical experts, and communication channels. By clearly delineating responsibilities, teams can swiftly respond to performance inconsistencies or ethical breaches, ensuring accountability and mitigating potential risks associated with AI deployment. Regular training and updates on these responsibilities further enhance preparedness and responsiveness in managing AI systems.

Defining roles and responsibilities is crucial for effectively managing the disengagement or deactivation of AI systems. This entails establishing a structured process for initiating, evaluating, and authorizing such actions, ensuring alignment with organizational protocols. Designating individuals or teams with the authority to make these decisions, coupled with their expertise and accountability, streamlines the process and enhances response efficiency.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly define roles and responsibilities for initiating, evaluating, and authorizing the disengagement or deactivation of AI systems.

2. Establish a clear chain of command for making such decisions, ensuring that it aligns with the organizational structure and decision-making processes.

3. Assign specific individuals or teams with the authority to make disengagement or deactivation decisions, ensuring they have the necessary expertise and accountability.

### Manage 2.4.5. Implement Prompt and Effective Disengagement Procedures.

Implementing prompt and effective disengagement procedures is essential for addressing instances where AI systems demonstrate performance or outcomes inconsistent with their intended use. These procedures should be designed to facilitate swift action, ensuring that disengagement or deactivation occurs in a timely manner to mitigate potential harm. By streamlining the process and clarifying responsibilities, organizations can respond efficiently to emerging issues, safeguarding against adverse impacts on stakeholders and upholding trust in AI technologies.

Instituting procedures for promptly disengaging or deactivating AI systems is crucial for responding effectively to unforeseen issues. These protocols should encompass notifying relevant stakeholders, documenting reasons for disengagement, and coordinating with other impacted systems. By continuously testing and refining these procedures, organizations can enhance their responsiveness and readiness to address emergent challenges, bolstering the trust and reliability of AI deployments.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement procedures for promptly disengaging or deactivating AI systems when the need arises.

2. These procedures should clearly outline the steps to be taken, including notification of relevant stakeholders, documentation of the reasons for disengagement, and coordination with other affected systems or processes.

3. Regularly test and refine the disengagement procedures to ensure their effectiveness and adaptability to new scenarios.

### Manage 2.4.6. Maintain Transparency and Accountability.

Ensuring transparency and accountability is essential in managing AI systems, particularly when considering disengagement or deactivation due to performance inconsistencies. This involves maintaining clear and open communication channels with stakeholders, providing explanations for decisions made, and holding individuals or teams responsible for their actions. By upholding transparency and accountability throughout the disengagement process, organizations can foster trust, mitigate potential risks, and uphold ethical standards in AI deployment.

Clearly communicating and transparently documenting the disengagement or deactivation of an AI system is essential for maintaining stakeholder trust and accountability. Providing detailed explanations of the reasons behind the action, along with the potential impact and mitigation steps, ensures stakeholders are informed and involved in the decision-making process. Additionally, documenting these events and justifications facilitates accountability and enables organizations to learn from past experiences, ultimately enhancing their AI governance practices.
