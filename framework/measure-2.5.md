## Measure 2.5: The AI system to be deployed is demonstrated to be valid and reliable. Limitations of the generalizability beyond the conditions under which the technology was developed are documented.

### Measure 2.5.1. Establish Validity and Reliability Criteria.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define clear and measurable criteria to assess the validity and reliability of the AI system, aligning with the AI system's intended purpose, trustworthiness characteristics, and organizational risk tolerance.

2. Consider factors such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, explainability, and consistency when establishing criteria.

3. Document the rationale behind the selection of criteria, ensuring they are relevant, quantifiable, and achievable.

### Measure 2.5.2. Design and Conduct Validation and Reliability Testing.

#### Sub Practices

1. Design comprehensive validation and reliability testing plans that outline the procedures for evaluating the AI system's performance against established criteria.

2. Select appropriate testing methodologies and tools to assess the AI system's validity and reliability in representative deployment settings.

3. Conduct validation and reliability testing in multiple phases, encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

### Measure 2.5.3. Collect and Analyze Testing Data.

#### Sub Practices

1. Collect data from validation and reliability testing, including metrics, qualitative observations, and error logs.

2. Analyze the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement in the AI system's validity and reliability.

3. Interpret the testing results in the context of the AI system's intended use, deployment settings, and organizational risk profile.

### Measure 2.5.4. Assess Generalizability Limitations.

#### Sub Practices

1. Evaluate the generalizability of the AI system beyond the conditions under which it was developed, considering factors such as data distribution, input types, and operational environments.

2. Document the limitations of generalizability, identifying potential sources of bias or performance degradation in different contexts.

3. Develop mitigation strategies to address identified limitations, such as data augmentation or adaptive learning mechanisms.

### Measure 2.5.5. Document Validation and Reliability Demonstration.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create a comprehensive documentation that summarizes the validity and reliability criteria, testing plans, test results, analysis findings, and generalizability limitations.

2. Document the demonstration of validity and reliability in representative deployment settings, including screenshots, data visualizations, and narrative explanations.

3. Share the documentation with relevant stakeholders, including developers, testers, risk managers, and decision-makers.

### Measure 2.5.6. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Validity and Reliability Measures.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of validity and reliability measures, identifying areas for improvement and updating criteria as the AI system evolves.

2. Gather feedback from stakeholders and incorporate new insights into testing methodologies and data collection strategies.

3. Maintain a living document that reflects the dynamic nature of the AI system's validity and reliability, ensuring it remains relevant and aligned with organizational objectives.
