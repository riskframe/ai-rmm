# Measure 4: Feedback about efficacy of measurement is gathered and assessed.

## Measure 4.1: Measurement approaches for identifying AI risks are connected to deployment context(s) and informed through consultation with domain experts and other end users. Approaches are documented.

### Measure 4.1.1. Identify Contextual Risk Parameters.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a comprehensive understanding of the AI system's deployment context(s), including the specific application domain, target users, and operational environment.

2. Identify the unique characteristics and challenges of each deployment context that may pose potential AI risks.

3. Analyze potential interactions between the AI system and its operational environment, considering factors such as data availability, infrastructure, and human-machine interactions.

### Measure 4.1.2. Consult Domain Experts and End Users.

#### Sub Practices

1. Engage with domain experts and end users who have deep knowledge of the specific application domain and the target user population.

2. Conduct workshops, interviews, and surveys to gather their insights on potential AI risks, based on their experience and expertise.

3. Document their perspectives and concerns to inform the development of risk identification and assessment methodologies.

### Measure 4.1.3. Design Context-Specific Measurement Approaches.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop measurement approaches that are tailored to the specific risks identified in each deployment context.

2. Consider utilizing a variety of risk assessment techniques, such as qualitative risk assessment, scenario analysis, and machine learning-based methods.

3. Incorporate domain expertise and user feedback into the design of measurement approaches to ensure their relevance and effectiveness.

### Measure 4.1.4. Document Measurement Approaches.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date documentation of measurement approaches for identifying AI risks across different deployment contexts.

2. Document the rationale behind each approach, including the specific risks it addresses, the data sources it utilizes, and the analysis methods it employs.

3. Regularly review and update measurement approaches based on lessons learned, emerging risks, and changes in the AI system's deployment context(s).

### Measure 4.1.5. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Measurement Approaches.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of measurement approaches in identifying and assessing AI risks in each deployment context.

2. Gather feedback from domain experts, end users, and AI developers to identify areas for improvement.

3. Adapt measurement approaches as needed to address emerging risks, changing user needs, or evolving technological advancements.

### Measure 4.1.6. Foster a Culture of Context-Aware Risk Management.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture of context-aware risk management throughout the AI development lifecycle.

2. Encourage collaboration between AI developers, domain experts, end users, and risk management professionals.

3. Integrate context-specific risk assessment into organizational policies, procedures, and governance frameworks.
