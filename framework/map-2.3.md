## Map 2.3: Scientific integrity and TEVV considerations are identified and documented, including those related to experimental design, data collection and selection (e.g., availability, representativeness, suitability), system trustworthiness, and construct validation

### Map 2.3.1. Establish a Scientific Integrity Framework.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement a comprehensive framework for ensuring scientific integrity throughout the AI development lifecycle.

2. Clearly define standards for experimental design, data collection, evaluation, and interpretation.

3. Establish clear guidelines for preventing and addressing biases, conflicts of interest, and other ethical concerns.

### Map 2.3.2. Implement Robust Experimental Design.

#### Sub Practices

1. Employ rigorous experimental design principles to ensure the reliability and validity of AI systems.

2. Randomize data collection and treatment assignment to minimize bias and confounding factors.

3. Control for extraneous variables to isolate the effects of the AI system.

### Map 2.3.3. Ensure Data Quality and Representativeness.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement rigorous data quality assessment procedures to identify and address data errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.

2. Evaluate the representativeness of the training data to ensure it accurately reflects the target population and usage scenarios.

3. Address data bias and ensure that the AI system is not inadvertently perpetuating discriminatory or unfair practices.

### Map 2.3.4. Assess System Trustworthiness.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and evaluate metrics to assess the trustworthiness of AI systems, including accuracy, fairness, explainability, robustness, and security.

2. Conduct rigorous testing and validation to ensure that the AI system meets acceptable performance standards.

3. Implement mechanisms for monitoring and auditing AI system behavior to identify and address potential issues.

### Map 2.3.5. Validate AI System Construct.

#### Sub Practices

1. Perform construct validation to ensure that the AI system is measuring the intended concept or construct accurately and consistently.

2. Validate AI system outputs against established benchmarks or expert judgment.

3. Use multiple methods and metrics to assess construct validity and ensure the reliability of AI system measurements.

### Map 2.3.6. Document Scientific Integrity and TEVV Considerations.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the scientific integrity and TEVV considerations that were applied throughout the AI development process.

2. Detail the specific experimental design choices, data collection methods, evaluation criteria, and trustworthiness assessments.

3. Explain the reasoning behind these decisions and provide supporting evidence for their validity.

### Map 2.3.7. Conduct Regular Reviews and Updates.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and update documentation on scientific integrity and TEVV considerations to reflect the evolving state of the AI system.

2. Incorporate feedback from stakeholders and experts to refine the framework and ensure its effectiveness.

3. Maintain a living document that captures the continuous learning and improvement process related to scientific integrity and TEVV in AI development.
