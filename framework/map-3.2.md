## Map 3.2: Potential costs, including non-monetary costs, which result from expected or realized AI errors or system functionality and trustworthiness – as connected to organizational risk tolerance – are examined and documented.

### Map 3.2.1. Identify and Assess Potential Costs.

#### Sub Practices

1. Analyze potential costs associated with AI errors, including financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and harm to individuals or society.

2. Consider both monetary and non-monetary costs, such as lost productivity, reduced customer satisfaction, and erosion of trust in AI technology.

3. Evaluate the potential for cascading effects, where AI errors can lead to further consequences and amplify the overall impact.

### Map 3.2.2. Assess Likelihood and Severity of Costs.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the likelihood of different types of AI errors occurring based on the characteristics of the AI system and its deployment environment.

2. Evaluate the potential severity of the costs associated with each type of error, considering the potential impact on individuals, organizations, and society.

3. Use risk assessment methodologies to quantify the likelihood and severity of potential costs.

### Map 3.2.3. Prioritize Costs Based on Organizational Risk Tolerance.

#### Sub Practices

1. Align the assessment of potential costs with the organization's established risk tolerance levels.

2. Prioritize costs that are considered unacceptable risks and require mitigation strategies.

3. Use risk tolerance frameworks to make informed decisions about resource allocation and focus.

### Map 3.2.4. Document Potential Costs and Mitigation Strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the potential costs associated with AI errors, their likelihood and severity, and the organization's risk tolerance.

2. Develop mitigation strategies for addressing identified risks, considering techniques such as error detection, prevention, and mitigation.

3. Assign ownership and timelines for implementing mitigation strategies.

### Map 3.2.5. Monitor and Evaluate Actual Costs.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the actual costs incurred due to AI errors.

2. Track data on errors, incidents, and associated costs to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

3. Use the gathered data to refine risk assessment models and improve the organization's overall approach to AI risk management.
