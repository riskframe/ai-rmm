## Map 3.2: Potential costs, including non-monetary costs, which result from expected or realized AI errors or system functionality and trustworthiness – as connected to organizational risk tolerance – are examined and documented.

### Map 3.2.1. Identify and Assess Potential Costs.

To thoroughly understand potential costs associated with AI errors or system functionality, organizations must identify and assess various types of costs, including both monetary and non-monetary implications. This process involves conducting a comprehensive analysis to identify potential risks and consequences that may arise from AI errors or system failures, considering factors such as financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and impacts on stakeholders. By examining and documenting these potential costs, organizations can effectively manage risks and make informed decisions regarding AI implementation and risk mitigation strategies.

Assessing potential costs linked to AI errors involves analyzing various factors such as financial losses, reputational harm, legal risks, and societal impacts. It also entails considering both monetary and non-monetary implications, like decreased productivity and diminished trust. Additionally, evaluating the potential for cascading effects helps understand how AI errors may lead to broader consequences, amplifying their overall impact.

#### Sub Practices

1. Analyze potential costs associated with AI errors, including financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and harm to individuals or society.

2. Consider both monetary and non-monetary costs, such as lost productivity, reduced customer satisfaction, and erosion of trust in AI technology.

3. Evaluate the potential for cascading effects, where AI errors can lead to further consequences and amplify the overall impact.

### Map 3.2.2. Assess Likelihood and Severity of Costs.

Analyzing the likelihood and severity of potential costs stemming from AI errors involves a thorough examination of various factors. This includes assessing the probability of occurrence for different types of errors and their potential impact on the organization. By considering factors such as the complexity of AI systems, the robustness of error detection mechanisms, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, organizations can better understand the overall risk landscape and make informed decisions to manage and mitigate potential costs effectively.

Assessing the likelihood and severity of potential costs involves evaluating various factors inherent in AI systems and their operational contexts. This includes examining the complexity of AI algorithms, the diversity of data sources, and the potential for errors to propagate through system interactions. By applying risk assessment methodologies, organizations can quantify the probability of different error types occurring and the magnitude of their impact, aiding in the prioritization of risk mitigation strategies and resource allocation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the likelihood of different types of AI errors occurring based on the characteristics of the AI system and its deployment environment.

2. Evaluate the potential severity of the costs associated with each type of error, considering the potential impact on individuals, organizations, and society.

3. Use risk assessment methodologies to quantify the likelihood and severity of potential costs.

### Map 3.2.3. Prioritize Costs Based on Organizational Risk Tolerance.

Assessing and prioritizing costs based on organizational risk tolerance involves a careful balancing act between potential risks and benefits associated with AI deployment. Organizations must first establish clear thresholds for acceptable risk levels, considering factors such as regulatory requirements, stakeholder expectations, and the nature of the AI application. By identifying and prioritizing potential costs according to these established thresholds, organizations can focus their resources on mitigating risks with the highest likelihood and severity of impact, thereby aligning their risk management efforts with strategic objectives and organizational values.

Aligning the assessment of potential costs with the organization's established risk tolerance levels involves evaluating the likelihood and severity of each cost while considering the organization's risk appetite. By prioritizing costs that exceed acceptable risk thresholds and necessitate mitigation efforts, organizations can focus their attention on addressing the most critical risks first. Utilizing risk tolerance frameworks enables informed decision-making regarding resource allocation and prioritization, ensuring that mitigation efforts align closely with organizational objectives and values.

#### Sub Practices

1. Align the assessment of potential costs with the organization's established risk tolerance levels.

2. Prioritize costs that are considered unacceptable risks and require mitigation strategies.

3. Use risk tolerance frameworks to make informed decisions about resource allocation and focus.

### Map 3.2.4. Document Potential Costs and Mitigation Strategies.

Documenting potential costs and mitigation strategies involves creating a comprehensive record of the identified risks and their associated impacts, both monetary and non-monetary, stemming from AI errors or system functionality issues. In addition to detailing the potential costs, organizations must outline proactive strategies to mitigate these risks effectively. This documentation should include a range of mitigation approaches tailored to address various types of risks, considering the organization's risk tolerance levels and overarching goals. By systematically documenting potential costs and corresponding mitigation strategies, organizations can enhance their preparedness to manage AI-related risks and minimize their negative impacts on operations and stakeholders.

This practice involves creating a comprehensive record of the identified risks and their associated impacts, both monetary and non-monetary, stemming from AI errors or system functionality issues. Additionally, it entails developing mitigation strategies for addressing identified risks, including techniques such as error detection, prevention, and mitigation, and assigning ownership and timelines for implementing these strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the potential costs associated with AI errors, their likelihood and severity, and the organization's risk tolerance.

2. Develop mitigation strategies for addressing identified risks, considering techniques such as error detection, prevention, and mitigation.

3. Assign ownership and timelines for implementing mitigation strategies.

### Map 3.2.5. Monitor and Evaluate Actual Costs.

Monitoring and evaluating actual costs involves systematically tracking and assessing the real-world impacts of AI errors or system functionality issues on both monetary and non-monetary fronts. It requires ongoing observation of incurred costs, such as financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties, as well as intangible costs like diminished trust and user dissatisfaction. By continuously monitoring actual costs, organizations can gauge the effectiveness of their mitigation strategies, identify emerging risks, and refine their risk management approach to enhance the overall resilience of their AI systems.

This practice involves establishing a robust mechanism for tracking and assessing the financial and non-financial impacts of AI errors. This includes continuously collecting data on errors, incidents, and associated costs, and using this information to refine risk assessment models and enhance mitigation strategies. By leveraging gathered data to inform decision-making, organizations can iteratively improve their approach to AI risk management, ensuring better resilience and effectiveness in mitigating potential harms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the actual costs incurred due to AI errors.

2. Track data on errors, incidents, and associated costs to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

3. Use the gathered data to refine risk assessment models and improve the organization's overall approach to AI risk management.
