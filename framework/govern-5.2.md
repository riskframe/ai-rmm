## Govern 5.2: Mechanisms are established to enable the team that developed or deployed AI systems to regularly incorporate adjudicated feedback from relevant AI actors into system design and implementation.

### Govern 5.2.1. Establish an Adjudication Process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a formal process for adjudicating feedback from relevant AI actors.

2. Define criteria for judging the relevance, expertise, and validity of feedback.

3. Designate individuals or teams with the authority to make informed decisions about which feedback to incorporate into AI systems.

### Govern 5.2.2. Establish Feedback Integration Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop mechanisms for integrating adjudicated feedback into the design and implementation of AI systems.

2. Create channels for communicating feedback to AI development and deployment teams.

3. Provide clear guidelines on how to incorporate feedback into specific aspects of AI development and deployment.

### Govern 5.2.3. Foster a Culture of Active Feedback Ingestion.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture that welcomes and encourages feedback from relevant AI actors.

2. Make it easy for individuals and groups to provide feedback on AI systems.

3. Recognize and reward individuals who provide valuable and constructive feedback.

### Govern 5.2.4. Integrate Feedback into Development Cycles.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate feedback into the development cycle of AI systems.

2. Schedule feedback review sessions at regular intervals throughout the development process.

3. Use feedback to inform design decisions, improve system functionality, and address potential risks.

### Govern 5.2.5. Track Feedback Incorporation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Track the incorporation of adjudicated feedback into AI systems.

2. Document the impact of feedback on system design, implementation, and performance.

3. Use feedback tracking data to improve the effectiveness of feedback mechanisms and the overall feedback-ingestion process.
