## Govern 5.2: Mechanisms are established to enable the team that developed or deployed AI systems to regularly incorporate adjudicated feedback from relevant AI actors into system design and implementation.

### Govern 5.2.1. Establish an Adjudication Process.

Establishing an adjudication process is essential for enabling the team responsible for developing or deploying AI systems to effectively incorporate feedback from relevant AI actors into system design and implementation. This process involves creating a structured framework for reviewing and evaluating the feedback received, identifying actionable insights, and making informed decisions on how to integrate these insights into the ongoing development and refinement of AI systems. By establishing clear criteria and procedures for adjudicating feedback, organizations can ensure that valuable insights are systematically considered and translated into improvements in AI system design and deployment practices.

Establishing a formal process for adjudicating feedback from relevant AI actors is crucial for ensuring that valuable insights are considered in the development and deployment of AI systems. This process involves defining criteria for evaluating the relevance, expertise, and validity of feedback, as well as designating individuals or teams responsible for making informed decisions about which feedback to incorporate. By systematically adjudicating feedback, organizations can enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of their AI systems while fostering collaboration and engagement with external stakeholders.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a formal process for adjudicating feedback from relevant AI actors.

2. Define criteria for judging the relevance, expertise, and validity of feedback.

3. Designate individuals or teams with the authority to make informed decisions about which feedback to incorporate into AI systems.

### Govern 5.2.2. Establish Feedback Integration Mechanisms.

To effectively incorporate adjudicated feedback from relevant AI actors into system design and implementation, organizations must establish robust feedback integration mechanisms. These mechanisms should facilitate seamless communication between stakeholders and the AI development team, enabling the timely incorporation of valuable insights into the system. By implementing efficient channels for feedback submission, review, and integration, organizations can ensure that their AI systems continuously evolve to meet the needs and expectations of stakeholders while maintaining alignment with organizational goals and ethical standards.

Incorporating adjudicated feedback into the design and implementation of AI systems involves developing mechanisms that facilitate seamless integration. This includes creating channels for communicating feedback to AI development and deployment teams and providing clear guidelines on how to incorporate feedback into specific aspects of AI development and deployment. By establishing robust feedback integration processes, organizations can ensure continuous improvement and alignment with stakeholder needs and expectations throughout the AI lifecycle.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop mechanisms for integrating adjudicated feedback into the design and implementation of AI systems.

2. Create channels for communicating feedback to AI development and deployment teams.

3. Provide clear guidelines on how to incorporate feedback into specific aspects of AI development and deployment.

### Govern 5.2.3. Foster a Culture of Active Feedback Ingestion.

To foster a culture of active feedback ingestion, organizations must cultivate an environment where receiving and acting upon feedback is encouraged and valued. This entails creating channels and processes that facilitate the continuous collection and incorporation of feedback from relevant AI actors. Moreover, it involves promoting open communication and collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and AI users to ensure that feedback is actively sought, considered, and integrated into the design and implementation of AI systems. By embracing a culture of active feedback ingestion, organizations can enhance the effectiveness, responsiveness, and adaptability of their AI initiatives, ultimately leading to better outcomes and stakeholder satisfaction.

Encouraging feedback from relevant AI actors involves creating an environment where sharing insights and opinions is valued and supported. Simplifying the feedback process and providing accessible channels for submission facilitate active participation. Additionally, acknowledging and rewarding those who contribute valuable and constructive feedback incentivizes ongoing engagement and collaboration, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation in AI development and deployment efforts.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture that welcomes and encourages feedback from relevant AI actors.

2. Make it easy for individuals and groups to provide feedback on AI systems.

3. Recognize and reward individuals who provide valuable and constructive feedback.

### Govern 5.2.4. Integrate Feedback into Development Cycles.

To ensure the continuous improvement of AI systems, it's crucial to integrate feedback into development cycles effectively. This involves incorporating adjudicated feedback from relevant AI actors into various stages of system design and implementation processes. By embedding feedback mechanisms into development cycles, teams can address identified issues promptly, refine system functionalities, and enhance overall performance. This iterative approach not only fosters collaboration and engagement but also promotes the delivery of AI solutions that better align with the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

Incorporating feedback into the development cycle of AI systems is essential for continuous improvement. By scheduling regular feedback review sessions and leveraging the insights gained, teams can make informed design decisions, enhance system functionality, and mitigate potential risks effectively.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate feedback into the development cycle of AI systems.

2. Schedule feedback review sessions at regular intervals throughout the development process.

3. Use feedback to inform design decisions, improve system functionality, and address potential risks.

### Govern 5.2.5. Track Feedback Incorporation.

Tracking feedback incorporation is crucial to ensuring accountability and transparency in the development and deployment of AI systems. By establishing clear tracking mechanisms, teams can monitor the integration of adjudicated feedback into system design and implementation processes. This enables them to identify areas where feedback has been successfully incorporated and areas that may require further attention or improvement. Additionally, tracking feedback incorporation facilitates ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of feedback mechanisms and informs iterative refinements to enhance stakeholder engagement and satisfaction.

Tracking the incorporation of adjudicated feedback into AI systems is essential for ensuring continual improvement and alignment with stakeholder needs. By documenting the impact of feedback on system design, implementation, and performance, teams can assess the effectiveness of their feedback mechanisms. Analyzing feedback tracking data allows for iterative enhancements to the feedback-ingestion process, fostering a culture of active engagement and responsiveness to stakeholder input.

#### Sub Practices

1. Track the incorporation of adjudicated feedback into AI systems.

2. Document the impact of feedback on system design, implementation, and performance.

3. Use feedback tracking data to improve the effectiveness of feedback mechanisms and the overall feedback-ingestion process.
