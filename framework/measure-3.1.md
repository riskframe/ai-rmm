## Measure 3.1: Approaches, personnel, and documentation are in place to regularly identify and track existing, unanticipated, and emergent AI risks based on factors such as intended and actual performance in deployed contexts.

### Measure 3.1.1. Establish a Risk Tracking Mechanism.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement a structured risk tracking mechanism to identify, document, and prioritize existing, unanticipated, and emergent AI risks.

2. Utilize a risk management tool or platform to maintain a centralized repository of risk information, including risk descriptions, assessment criteria, and mitigation strategies.

3. Define clear risk categorization schemes to classify risks based on their severity, likelihood, and potential impact.

### Measure 3.1.2. Establish a Risk Identification Process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define a formal process for identifying AI risks throughout the AI system's lifecycle, from development to deployment and operation.

2. Establish a risk identification team comprising AI experts, domain experts, and risk management professionals.

3. Implement various risk identification techniques, such as risk workshops, audits, and data analysis, to identify potential risks.

### Measure 3.1.3. Assess Risk Severity and Likelihood.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the severity of each identified AI risk based on its potential impact on various stakeholders, including individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.

2. Evaluate the likelihood of each risk occurring based on factors such as the AI system's design, implementation, and operational environment.

3. Utilize risk assessment matrices or tools to quantify the severity and likelihood of risks, providing a clear indication of their overall risk profile.

### Measure 3.1.4. Prioritize Risks and Implement Mitigation Strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Prioritize risks based on their severity and likelihood, focusing on the most critical risks that pose the greatest threats to the AI system's trustworthiness and its potential impacts on stakeholders.

2. Develop and implement mitigation strategies for prioritized risks, considering various risk mitigation options, such as system redesign, process improvements, or additional controls.

3. Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and adapt them as needed to address emerging risks or changing circumstances.

### Measure 3.1.5. Establish Risk Reporting and Communication Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement regular risk reporting mechanisms to communicate risk information to relevant stakeholders, including AI developers, operators, risk managers, and senior management.

2. Develop clear and concise risk reports that summarize risk identification, assessment, prioritization, and mitigation activities.

3. Establish clear communication channels to ensure that risk information is effectively shared and understood by all stakeholders.

### Measure 3.1.6. Continuously Monitor and Adapt Risk Management.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly monitor the AI system's performance and identify new or emerging risks throughout its lifecycle.

2. Conduct periodic risk reviews to assess the effectiveness of risk management practices and identify areas for improvement.

3. Stay informed about emerging AI risks, advancements in risk management techniques, and regulatory changes to adapt risk management strategies accordingly.

### Measure 3.1.7. Promote Risk Culture.

#### Sub Practices

1. Foster a culture of risk awareness and responsibility throughout the organization, emphasizing the importance of identifying, managing, and mitigating AI risks proactively.

2. Educate and train AI developers, operators, decision-makers, and other stakeholders on risk management principles, methodologies, and best practices.

3. Integrate risk management considerations into organizational policies, procedures, and governance frameworks to ensure ongoing risk assessment and mitigation.
