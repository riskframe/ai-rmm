# Govern 3: Workforce diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility processes are prioritized in the mapping, measuring, and managing of AI risks throughout the lifecycle.

## Govern 3.1: Decision-making related to mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks throughout the lifecycle is informed by a diverse team (e.g., diversity of demographics, disciplines, experience, expertise, and backgrounds).

### Govern 3.1.1. Foster a Culture of Inclusiveness.

To foster a culture of inclusiveness in decision-making processes related to AI risk management, organizations should prioritize diversity in team composition, ensuring representation from a variety of demographics, disciplines, experiences, expertise, and backgrounds. By embracing diversity, organizations can leverage a wide range of perspectives and insights, leading to more comprehensive risk assessments and effective risk management strategies. Encouraging open dialogue and creating a supportive environment where all voices are heard and valued further reinforces inclusiveness within the team, ultimately enhancing the organization's ability to address AI risks throughout the lifecycle.

Emphasizing the importance of inclusivity, organizations should cultivate a culture that embraces the diversity of thought, perspective, and background in AI risk management discussions. By fostering open and respectful communication among team members with varying viewpoints, organizations can leverage the richness of diverse experiences to enhance the effectiveness of risk management strategies. Additionally, addressing unconscious bias and creating an environment where everyone feels empowered to participate in decision-making processes fosters inclusiveness and ensures comprehensive consideration of AI risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture that values diversity of thought, perspective, and background in AI risk management discussions.

2. Encourage open and respectful communication among team members with varying viewpoints.

3. Address unconscious bias and ensure that everyone feels comfortable participating in AI risk management decision-making processes.

### Govern 3.1.2. Establish a Diverse Risk Management Team.

Emphasizing inclusivity and diversity, organizations should establish a risk management team comprising individuals from varied demographics, disciplines, experiences, expertise, and backgrounds. By assembling a diverse team, organizations can leverage a wide range of perspectives and insights to effectively identify, assess, and mitigate AI risks throughout the lifecycle. This diverse composition fosters creativity, innovation, and comprehensive consideration of potential risks, ultimately enhancing the organization's ability to navigate the complexities of AI technologies while promoting equity and inclusiveness in decision-making processes.

By incorporating individuals from various demographic groups, disciplines, and areas of expertise, organizations can create a diverse risk management team, enriching AI risk management efforts with a broader range of insights and perspectives. Seeking individuals with diverse experiences and backgrounds enhances the team's ability to address complex challenges and identify potential risks comprehensively. It's essential to ensure that team members possess the requisite skills and knowledge to actively contribute to AI risk management discussions, fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment conducive to effective decision-making.

#### Sub Practices
