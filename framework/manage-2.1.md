# Manage 2: Strategies to maximize AI benefits and minimize negative impacts are planned, prepared, implemented, documented, and informed by input from relevant AI actors.

## Manage 2.1: Resources required to manage AI risks are taken into account – along with viable non-AI alternative systems, approaches, or methods – to reduce the magnitude or likelihood of potential impacts.

### Manage 2.1.1. Evaluate Resource Allocation and Constraints.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the resources required to implement effective AI risk management strategies, including personnel, financial resources, and technical capabilities.

2. Identify and consider any resource constraints or limitations that may impact the feasibility of risk mitigation measures.

3. Evaluate the potential benefits and costs of investing in additional resources to enhance AI risk management capabilities.

### Manage 2.1.2. Explore Viable Non-AI Alternatives.

#### Sub Practices

1. Investigate and evaluate non-AI alternative systems, approaches, or methods that could be used to achieve similar outcomes without introducing or exacerbating AI risks.

2. Consider the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-benefit analysis of non-AI alternatives compared to AI-based solutions.

3. Document the rationale for choosing AI or non-AI solutions based on a comprehensive assessment of risks, benefits, and resource constraints.

### Manage 2.1.3. Minimize AI System Reliance.

#### Sub Practices

1. Design and implement AI systems in a way that minimizes their reliance on AI technologies and algorithms, particularly in areas where AI risks are high or where non-AI alternatives are feasible.

2. Employ hybrid solutions that combine AI capabilities with non-AI elements to enhance overall system trustworthiness and reduce reliance on AI alone.

3. Regularly review and evaluate the AI system's reliance on AI components to identify opportunities for reducing AI dependence.

### Manage 2.1.4. Leverage Existing Risk Management Frameworks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate AI risk management efforts into existing organizational risk management frameworks and processes.

2. Leverage existing risk assessment, mitigation, and communication methodologies to enhance the effectiveness of AI risk management.

3. Establish clear interfaces and communication channels between AI risk management activities and other risk management processes.

### Manage 2.1.5. Foster a Culture of Resource Optimization.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture of resource optimization and cost-effectiveness within AI risk management practices.

2. Encourage the use of data-driven decision-making and risk-based prioritization to allocate resources effectively.

3. Explore innovative approaches and technologies to enhance AI risk management efficiency and reduce resource consumption.

### Manage 2.1.6. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt AI Risk Management Strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and evaluate AI risk management strategies in light of changing organizational needs, technological advancements, and emerging risks.

2. Adapt and refine risk management approaches based on new information, lessons learned, and evolving risk profiles.

3. Maintain a continuous cycle of improvement and continuous adaptation to ensure the effectiveness of AI risk management practices.
