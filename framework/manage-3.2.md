## Manage 3.2: Pre-trained models which are used for development are monitored as part of AI system regular monitoring and maintenance.

### Manage 3.2.1. Establish Pre-trained Model Inventory and Tracking.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create a comprehensive inventory of all pre-trained models used in the development and deployment of AI systems.

2. Maintain detailed records of each pre-trained model, including its source, purpose, version, and usage history.

3. Implement automated tools or manual processes to track the lifecycle of pre-trained models, including creation, deployment, updates, and decommissioning.

### Manage 3.2.2. Conduct Regular Monitoring of Pre-trained Model Performance.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish ongoing monitoring mechanisms to track the performance, accuracy, and fairness of pre-trained models in real-time or at regular intervals.

2. Utilize analytics tools, performance metrics, and user feedback to detect anomalies, degradation, or biases in model behavior.

3. Proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact AI system performance or stakeholder trust.

### Manage 3.2.3. Implement Continuous Verification and Validation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly verify and validate the accuracy, fairness, and robustness of pre-trained models against updated datasets and usage scenarios.

2. Employ data validation techniques, bias detection algorithms, and robustness testing frameworks to assess model performance under varying conditions.

3. Document the results of verification and validation activities to track trends, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about model maintenance or replacement.

### Manage 3.2.4. Manage Pre-trained Model Updates and Updates.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a process for managing and updating pre-trained models to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness.

2. Proactively identify and apply updates released by model developers or providers to address known issues, improve performance, or adapt to new data.

3. Test and validate updated models before integrating them into AI systems to minimize the risk of introducing new problems or performance degradation.

### Manage 3.2.5. Establish Decommissioning Procedures for Pre-trained Models.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement procedures for decommissioning and removing outdated or unused pre-trained models from AI systems.

2. Ensure that decommissioning procedures are documented and adhered to to maintain system efficiency and reduce potential security risks.

3. Track the decommissioning of pre-trained models to ensure that they are no longer in use and that their associated data is properly secured and disposed of.

### Manage 3.2.6. Foster a Culture of Pre-trained Model Awareness.

#### Sub Practices

1. Educate AI developers, operators, and stakeholders about the importance of managing pre-trained models responsibly.

2. Highlight the potential risks associated with using outdated or unsupported models, such as performance degradation, bias, and security vulnerabilities.

3. Integrate pre-trained model management practices into organizational policies, procedures, and training programs to promote a culture of continuous improvement and risk mitigation.
