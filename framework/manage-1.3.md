## Manage 1.3: Responses to the AI risks deemed high priority, as identified by the map function, are developed, planned, and documented. Risk response options can include mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting.

### Manage 1.3.1. Identify and Prioritize High-Priority Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Leverage the risk assessment process from Map 1.2 to identify and prioritize AI risks based on their impact, likelihood, and available resources.

2. Focus on the most critical risks that pose the greatest potential threats to the AI system's trustworthiness and its impact on stakeholders.

3. Establish a clear and documented process for identifying, prioritizing, and managing high-priority risks throughout the AI lifecycle.

### Manage 1.3.2. Develop Risk Response Options.

#### Sub Practices

1. For each prioritized AI risk, develop tailored risk response options that aim to reduce or eliminate the risk's potential impact.

2. Consider a range of risk response options, including mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting the risk.

3. Assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-benefit analysis of each potential risk response option.

### Manage 1.3.3. Mitigate Identified Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement specific actions, timelines, and responsible parties to address the identified AI risk.

2. Focus on mitigating the root causes of the risk, rather than simply addressing symptoms or consequences.

3. Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures, making adjustments as needed.

### Manage 1.3.4. Transfer Risks to External Parties.

#### Sub Practices

1. Seek to transfer or share the financial or operational burden associated with the identified AI risk to another party, such as through insurance or outsourcing.

2. Carefully evaluate the terms and conditions of risk transfer agreements to ensure that the AI system's overall trustworthiness is not compromised.

3. Establish clear procedures for managing and monitoring risks that have been transferred to third parties.

### Manage 1.3.5. Avoid the Realization of Identified Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify and implement strategies to eliminate the potential for the identified AI risk to materialize.

2. This may involve redesigning the AI system, altering its operational parameters, or limiting its scope of application.

3. Carefully consider the potential tradeoffs associated with avoiding risks, such as potential benefits that may be lost along with the risk.

### Manage 1.3.6. Accept Unavoidable Risks with Contingency Plans.

#### Sub Practices

1. Acknowledge that some AI risks may be unavoidable, given the system's complexity, limitations, or the inherent nature of the technology.

2. Develop mitigation plans to minimize the potential impact of these risks, such as contingency plans or communication strategies.

3. Regularly review and reassess the decision to accept risks, taking into account new information, emerging risks, or changes in circumstances.

### Manage 1.3.7. Document and Communicate Risk Response Actions.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain comprehensive documentation of all risk responses, including the identified risk, the chosen risk response option, the rationale behind the decision, and the implementation plan.

2. Share this documentation with relevant stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the risk management process.

### Manage 1.3.8. Foster a Culture of Risk-Awareness and Proactive Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture of risk-awareness and responsibility throughout the AI development lifecycle.

2. Educate AI developers, operators, and decision-makers on risk identification, assessment, prioritization, and mitigation strategies.

3. Integrate risk management principles into organizational policies, procedures, and training programs.
