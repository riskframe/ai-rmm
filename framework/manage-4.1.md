# Manage 4: Risk treatments, including response and recovery, and communication plans for the identified and measured AI risks are documented and monitored regularly.

## Manage 4.1: Post-deployment AI system monitoring plans are implemented, including mechanisms for capturing and evaluating input from users and other relevant AI actors, appeal and override, decommissioning, incident response, recovery, and change management.

### Manage 4.1.1. Establish a Post-Deployment Monitoring Plan.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop a comprehensive post-deployment monitoring plan for the AI system to continuously assess its performance, effectiveness, and trustworthiness.

2. The plan should outline the metrics to be monitored, the frequency of monitoring, and the responsibilities for collecting and analyzing data.

3. Regularly review and update the monitoring plan to reflect changing requirements, technological advancements, and emerging risks.

### Manage 4.1.2. Capture and Evaluate User Feedback.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish mechanisms to capture and evaluate feedback from users and other relevant AI actors, such as system operators, downstream acquirers, and stakeholders.

2. Utilize surveys, feedback forms, user interviews, and direct observations to gather insights into user experiences, perceived system performance, and areas for improvement.

3. Analyze feedback data to identify trends, identify potential issues, and prioritize improvement efforts.

### Manage 4.1.3. Implement an Appeal and Override Mechanism.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a formal appeal and override mechanism for users to challenge AI system decisions that they believe are inaccurate, biased, or unfair.

2. Develop clear guidelines for appeals, including the process for submitting appeals, the criteria for review, and the decision-making authority.

3. Ensure that the appeal and override mechanism is accessible, transparent, and impartial to maintain user trust and confidence in the AI system.

### Manage 4.1.4. Develop a Decommissioning Plan.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop a comprehensive decommissioning plan for the AI system to ensure its orderly retirement and removal from service.

2. The plan should outline the process for identifying and documenting dependencies, archiving data, and ensuring system compatibility with existing infrastructure.

3. Establish a clear timeline for decommissioning activities and communicate the plan to affected stakeholders to minimize disruption and maintain system availability.

### Manage 4.1.5. Implement Incident Response and Recovery Procedures.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish incident response procedures to effectively address any unexpected or critical issues that may arise during the operation of the AI system.

2. The procedures should outline the roles and responsibilities of key personnel, communication protocols, and procedures for containment, mitigation, and recovery.

3. Regularly test and update the incident response plan to ensure its effectiveness in addressing new risks and evolving circumstances.

### Manage 4.1.6. Implement Change Management Processes.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement change management processes to control and manage changes to the AI system, including updates, modifications, and new deployments.

2. The processes should establish a clear change approval process, thorough testing procedures, and a rollback mechanism in case of unforeseen issues.

3. Ensure that changes are thoroughly documented and communicated to affected stakeholders to maintain system stability and minimize disruptions.

### Manage 4.1.7. Foster a Culture of Continuous Monitoring and Improvement.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture of continuous monitoring and improvement throughout the AI system lifecycle.

2. Encourage open communication and collaboration among AI developers, operators, users, and stakeholders to identify and address issues promptly.

3. Integrate AI monitoring practices into organizational policies, procedures, and training programs to ensure a holistic approach to system trustworthiness and effectiveness.
