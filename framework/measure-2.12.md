## Measure 2.12: Environmental impact and sustainability of AI model training and management activities – as identified in the map function – are assessed and documented.

### Measure 2.12.1. Identify and Assess Environmental Impact.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify and assess the environmental impact of AI model training and management activities, considering factors such as energy consumption, resource utilization, and greenhouse gas emissions.

2. Evaluate the AI system's impact on the environment throughout its lifecycle, from data collection and processing to model deployment and operation.

3. Assess the potential consequences of environmental impact on various stakeholders, including the organization responsible for the AI system, society as a whole, and future generations.

### Measure 2.12.2. Develop Environmental Mitigation Strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of AI model training and management activities, promoting sustainable practices.

2. Consider using energy-efficient algorithms, cloud-based computing, and carbon offsetting mechanisms to reduce energy consumption.

3. Implement data optimization techniques and reduce data storage requirements to minimize resource utilization.

### Measure 2.12.3. Establish Environmental Reporting Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement regular reporting mechanisms to track the progress of environmental impact mitigation efforts, identify emerging concerns, and communicate with stakeholders.

2. Report on the AI system's environmental sustainability practices to relevant stakeholders, including users, regulators, and environmental oversight bodies.

3. Disseminate environmental impact reports to promote transparency, foster responsible AI practices, and demonstrate commitment to environmental sustainability.

### Measure 2.12.4. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Environmental Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of environmental mitigation strategies, identifying areas for improvement and adapting measures as technologies and practices evolve.

2. Gather feedback from internal and external stakeholders to refine environmental impact management practices.

3. Stay informed about emerging best practices and technological advancements in sustainable AI development and deployment.

### Measure 2.12.5. Document Environmental Impact Assessment and Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain a comprehensive record of environmental impact assessments, mitigation strategies, and evaluation findings.

2. Document the rationale behind risk identification, mitigation choices, and decision-making processes.

3. Share environmental impact documentation with relevant stakeholders to promote transparency and accountability throughout the organization.

### Measure 2.12.6. Promote Environmental Awareness and Stewardship.

#### Sub Practices

1. Foster a culture of environmental awareness and responsibility throughout the AI development lifecycle, embedding sustainability principles into AI development practices.

2. Educate and train AI developers, operators, and decision-makers on environmental impact assessment methodologies, mitigation techniques, and sustainable AI practices.

3. Integrate environmental sustainability considerations into organizational policies, procedures, and governance frameworks.
