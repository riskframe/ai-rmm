## Govern 1.5: Ongoing monitoring and periodic review of the risk management process and its outcomes are planned and organizational roles and responsibilities clearly defined, including determining the frequency of periodic review.

### Govern 1.5.1. Define the scope and frequency of monitoring.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly define the scope of monitoring activities, including which AI systems, processes, and data will be subject to ongoing scrutiny.

2. Determine the frequency of periodic reviews, considering factors such as the complexity of AI systems, the level of risk, and the organization's risk tolerance.

3. Establish a schedule for regular reviews and ensure that they are integrated into the overall AI governance lifecycle.

### Govern 1.5.2. Identify monitoring metrics and indicators.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the AI risk management process.

2. Select relevant indicators that provide insights into the risk profile of AI systems, such as data quality, algorithmic fairness, explainability, accountability, and security measures.

3. Regularly collect and analyze data to track the performance of AI systems and assess the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.

### Govern 1.5.3. Establish a monitoring and alerting system.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement a system for monitoring AI systems and data in real-time or near real-time to identify potential risks or anomalies.

2. Set up alerts and notifications to notify relevant stakeholders of potential issues or deviations from established risk thresholds.

3. Develop a clear escalation process for handling critical incidents that require immediate attention.

### Govern 1.5.4. Assign clear roles and responsibilities,.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define specific roles and responsibilities for monitoring and reviewing the AI risk management process.

2. Allocate clear ownership of monitoring activities to ensure accountability and timely action.

3. Establish a cross-functional team with representatives from various departments, such as AI development, risk management, security, data governance, and ethics.

### Govern 1.5.5. Document monitoring and review procedures.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop detailed procedures for conducting ongoing monitoring and periodic reviews of the AI risk management process.

2. Clearly outline the steps involved in data collection, analysis, risk assessment, and reporting.

3. Ensure these procedures are accessible to all relevant stakeholders and regularly reviewed and updated.

### Govern 1.5.6. Integrate monitoring and review into organizational workflows.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate monitoring and review activities into the regular workflows of AI development, deployment, and operation teams.

2. Automate certain monitoring tasks, such as data quality checks and algorithmic fairness assessments, to enhance timeliness and efficiency.

3. Establish a feedback loop to incorporate insights from monitoring and review activities into the continuous improvement of AI risk management practices.
