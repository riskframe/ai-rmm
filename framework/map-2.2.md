## Map 2.2: Information about the AI systemâ€™s knowledge limits and how system output may be utilized and overseen by humans is documented. Documentation provides sufficient information to assist relevant AI actors when making decisions and taking subsequent actions.

### Map 2.2.1. Identify and Document AI System Knowledge Limits.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the AI system's knowledge base and its ability to understand, process, and generate information.

2. Identify potential sources of bias, data limitations, and areas where the AI system may lack expertise.

3. Document the system's knowledge limits in a clear and concise manner, specifying the types of situations where the AI system may need human intervention or guidance.

### Map 2.2.2. Define Human Oversight and Overriding Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish clear procedures for human oversight and intervention in the AI system's operation.

2. Define roles and responsibilities for human operators who will monitor, interpret, and approve AI-generated outputs.

3. Implement mechanisms for human operators to override or correct AI decisions when necessary.

### Map 2.2.3. Document Human Oversight and Overriding Procedures.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the specific human oversight and overriding procedures for the AI system.

2. Detail the roles and responsibilities of human operators, including their training requirements and decision-making processes.

3. Explain the triggers for human intervention and how overriding actions will be initiated and documented.

### Map 2.2.4. Integrate Human Oversight and Overriding into System Architecture.

#### Sub Practices

1. Design the AI system's architecture to facilitate human oversight and overriding capabilities.

2. Develop interfaces for human operators to interact with the AI system, receive alerts, and initiate intervention processes.

3. Implement mechanisms for logging and tracking human oversight and overriding activities for auditing and accountability purposes.

### Map 2.2.5. Continuously Assess and Update Knowledge Limits Documentation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and update documentation on the AI system's knowledge limits as the system evolves and new data is incorporated.

2. Incorporate feedback from human operators and stakeholders to refine understanding of the system's capabilities and limitations.

3. Maintain a living document that reflects the current knowledge of the AI system's capabilities and the role of human oversight in ensuring responsible decision-making.
