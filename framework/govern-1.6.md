## Govern 1.6: Mechanisms are in place to inventory AI systems and are resourced according to organizational risk priorities.

### Govern 1.6.1. Inventory AI systems.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a comprehensive inventory of all AI systems in use within the organization, including their purpose, capabilities, and data sources.

2. Utilize automated tools and techniques to identify and classify AI systems, ensuring a thorough and up-to-date inventory.

3. Document the inventory in a central repository accessible to relevant stakeholders.

### Govern 1.6.2. Assess AI system risk levels.

#### Sub Practices

1. Evaluate the risk associated with each AI system using a structured approach, considering factors such as data sensitivity, potential impact on affected parties, and the likelihood of bias or fairness issues.

2. Assign risk scores to each AI system,categorizing them into different risk levels, such as high, medium, or low.

3. Use risk scores to prioritize resource allocation and risk mitigation efforts.

### Govern 1.6.3. Prioritize resource allocation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Allocate resources for AI risk management based on the identified risk levels of AI systems.

2. Focus resources on systems with higher risk levels to address the most critical risks first.

3. Develop a risk-based budgeting approach to ensure that resources are aligned with the organization's risk appetite and priorities.

### Govern 1.6.4. Establish a risk-based staffing model.

#### Sub Practices

1. Determine the staffing requirements for AI risk management activities, considering the number and complexity of AI systems, the frequency of monitoring and review, and the organization's risk tolerance.

2. Recruit and retain qualified personnel with expertise in AI risk management, data governance, ethics, and security.

3. Implement a competency framework to establish clear expectations for knowledge, skills, and experience in AI risk management.

3. Establish a governance structure that facilitates collaboration and communication between risk management and other relevant departments.

### Govern 1.6.6. Continuously evaluate and refine risk management processes.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and update the AI risk management inventory, assessment methodology, and resource allocation strategy.

2. Incorporate lessons learned from risk management activities into the continuous improvement cycle.

3. Adapt risk management practices to address emerging AI technologies and evolving risk landscapes.
