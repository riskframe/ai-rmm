## Govern 1.3: Processes, procedures, and practices are in place to determine the needed level of risk management activities based on the organization's risk tolerance.

### Govern 1.3.1. Establish an organizational risk tolerance framework.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define the organization's overall risk tolerance for AI systems, considering factors such as business objectives, societal impact, and ethical considerations.

2. Develop a risk tolerance matrix that maps AI risks to corresponding risk mitigation strategies.

3. Establish a process for regularly assessing and updating the risk tolerance framework as AI systems evolve.

### Govern 1.3.2. Identify and assess AI-related risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential AI-related risks, including bias, fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and security vulnerabilities.

2. Use a structured approach to risk assessment, considering factors such as the likelihood and impact of each risk.

3. Document the results of risk assessments in a comprehensive risk register.

### Govern 1.3.3. Prioritize and categorize AI risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Prioritize AI risks based on their potential impact on the organization's goals, ethical principles, and regulatory compliance.

2. Categorize AI risks into different levels of severity, such as high, medium, or low.

3. Use risk categorization to guide risk mitigation efforts and resource allocation.

### Govern 1.3.4. Develop and implement risk mitigation strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Design and implement risk mitigation strategies tailored to the specific risks identified in the risk assessment.

2. Consider a range of mitigation techniques, such as data cleaning, algorithmic fairness training, explainability methods, accountability mechanisms, and security controls.

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies on an ongoing basis.

### Govern 1.3.5. Establish a risk management governance structure.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a cross-functional risk management team with representatives from various departments, such as AI development, security, legal, and ethics.

2. Define clear roles and responsibilities for the risk management team, including risk identification, assessment, mitigation, and reporting.

3. Implement a clear communication and escalation process for managing AI-related risk events.

### Govern 1.3.6. Continuously monitor and update risk management practices.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly monitor AI systems for emerging risks and potential changes in risk levels.

2. Regularly review and update risk assessments and risk mitigation strategies.

3. Incorporate lessons learned from risk management activities into the organization's overall AI governance framework.
