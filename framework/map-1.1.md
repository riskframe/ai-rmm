# Map 1: Context is established and understood.

## Map 1.1: Intended purposes, potentially beneficial uses, context-specific laws, norms and expectations, and prospective settings in which the AI system will be deployed are understood and documented. Considerations include: the specific set or types of users along with their expectations; potential positive and negative impacts of system uses to individuals, communities, organizations, society, and the planet; assumptions and related limitations about AI system purposes, uses, and risks across the development or product AI lifecycle; and related Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation (TEVV) and system metrics.

### Map 1.1.1. Clearly Define Intended Purposes and Beneficial Uses.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish clear and concise documentation of the intended purposes of the AI system.

2. Identify the specific benefits that the AI system aims to achieve for its users, organizations, and society.

3. Align intended purposes and beneficial uses with the organization's overall strategic goals and objectives.

### Map 1.1.2. Identify Context-Specific Laws, Norms, and Expectations.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the legal, regulatory, ethical, and social norms relevant to the AI system's intended use.

2. Assess potential ethical considerations, such as fairness, bias, and privacy, in the context of the AI system's operation.

3. Consider the cultural and societal context in which the AI system will be deployed.

### Map 1.1.3. Define Prospective Deployment Settings.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly define the specific environments and settings where the AI system will be deployed.

2. Consider factors such as user demographics, technical infrastructure, and operational requirements.

3. Identify potential interactions with other systems or data sources in the deployment environment.

### Map 1.1.4. Understand User Expectations and Impacts.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct user research to understand the expectations, needs, and concerns of the AI system's target users.

2. Identify potential positive and negative impacts of the AI system on individuals, communities, organizations, society, and the planet.

3. Assess the potential for unintended consequences and ethical concerns arising from the AI system's operation.

### Map 1.1.5. Document Assumptions, Limitations, and TEVV.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly document the assumptions and limitations related to the AI system's intended purposes, uses, and risks.

2. Outline the Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation (TEVV) strategy for ensuring the AI system's reliability, performance, and compliance with requirements.

3. Define system metrics to measure the effectiveness and impact of the AI system.

### Map 1.1.6. Conduct Continuous Mapping Throughout the AI Lifecycle.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and update the understanding of intended purposes, beneficial uses, context-specific considerations, and assumptions as the AI system evolves.

2. Adapt TEVV plans and system metrics to reflect changes in the AI system's design, development, and deployment.

3. Maintain a centralized repository to document all mapping information and ensure accessibility for relevant stakeholders.
