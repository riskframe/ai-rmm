## Measure 4.3: Measurable performance improvements or declines based on consultations with relevant AI actors, including affected communities, and field data about context-relevant risks and trustworthiness characteristics are identified and documented.

### Measure 4.3.1. Gather Field Data and Identify Performance Trends.

#### Sub Practices

1. Continuously collect and analyze field data related to the AI system's performance, including metrics such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, and user satisfaction.

2. Utilize various data sources, such as system logs, user feedback, and performance assessments, to gather a comprehensive picture of the AI system's performance across different deployment contexts.

3. Employ data analytics techniques to identify patterns and trends in performance metrics, both positive and negative.

### Measure 4.3.2. Consult with Relevant AI Actors and Affected Communities.

#### Sub Practices

1. Engage with relevant AI actors, including AI developers, operators, decision-makers, and representatives from impacted communities, to gather their insights on the AI system's performance.

2. Conduct workshops, interviews, and surveys to understand their perspectives on the system's effectiveness, its impact on individuals and society, and any potential risks or concerns.

3. Document their feedback and input to inform the assessment of performance improvements or declines.

### Measure 4.3.3. Identify and Correlate Risks and Trustworthiness Characteristics.

#### Sub Practices

1. Analyze field data and consultations with AI actors to identify potential correlations between changes in performance and specific context-relevant risks or trustworthiness characteristics.

2. Explore these correlations to understand how specific aspects of the AI system's design, implementation, or deployment may influence its performance and trustworthiness.

3. Develop hypotheses about the factors that contribute to performance improvements or declines.

### Measure 4.3.4. Document Measurable Performance Changes.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain a comprehensive record of measurable performance changes, including the specific metrics that have been affected, the magnitude of the changes, and the relevant time frames.

2. Document the findings from correlations between performance changes and context-relevant risks or trustworthiness characteristics.

3. Share this documentation with relevant stakeholders to promote transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.

### Measure 4.3.5. Continuously Monitor and Adapt Performance Monitoring.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly monitor field data and consultations with AI actors to identify new trends, patterns, and potential risks that may affect performance.

2. Adapt data collection and analysis methodologies as needed to capture emerging trends and refine understanding of performance dynamics.

3. Foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement in performance monitoring throughout the AI lifecycle.

### Measure 4.3.6. Promote Evidence-Based Performance Improvement.

#### Sub Practices

1. Employ the identified correlations between context-relevant risks, trustworthiness characteristics, and performance to guide the development of targeted performance improvement initiatives.

2. Prioritize evidence-based interventions that address the root causes of performance issues, rather than relying solely on reactive mitigation strategies.

3. Make performance improvement a core objective of AI development and deployment, ensuring that AI systems consistently deliver value and meet the needs of stakeholders.
