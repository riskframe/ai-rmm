### Measure 4.3.1. Gather Field Data and Identify Performance Trends.

Continuously collecting and analyzing field data related to the AI system's performance is essential for understanding how the system operates in real-world conditions. Metrics such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, and user satisfaction provide a multi-dimensional view of the system's performance, reflecting its technical capabilities as well as its impact on users. By aggregating data from diverse sources, including system logs, user feedback, and performance assessments, organizations can construct a detailed picture of the AI system's performance, capturing its strengths and areas for improvement across various deployment contexts.

Employing advanced data analytics techniques to examine this wealth of information allows organizations to uncover patterns and trends in the performance data. This analysis can reveal both positive trends, indicating areas where the AI system excels, and negative trends, highlighting potential issues that require attention. Identifying these trends is crucial for making informed decisions about system enhancements and for addressing any performance declines proactively. This ongoing process of gathering and analyzing field data ensures that AI systems continue to meet and exceed performance expectations, maintaining their effectiveness and trustworthiness over time.

### Measure 4.3.2. Consult with Relevant AI Actors and Affected Communities.

Engaging with relevant AI actors and representatives from impacted communities is crucial for obtaining a holistic understanding of an AI system's performance. By involving AI developers, operators, decision-makers, and those directly affected by the system's deployment, organizations can gain diverse perspectives on the system's effectiveness, its societal impact, and any associated risks or concerns. Workshops, interviews, and surveys are effective methods for capturing these insights, providing a platform for stakeholders to share their experiences and observations. This inclusive approach ensures that the evaluation of the AI system encompasses a wide range of viewpoints, reflecting the varied ways in which different groups interact with and are influenced by the system.

Documenting the feedback and input from these consultations is essential for accurately assessing performance improvements or declines. The collected insights not only enrich the understanding of the AI system's real-world performance but also highlight areas that may require attention or adjustment. By incorporating this feedback into the performance assessment process, organizations can ensure that their evaluations are grounded in the actual experiences of those who develop, operate, and are impacted by the AI system. This comprehensive approach to consultation and documentation supports informed decision-making and fosters continuous improvement in AI system development and deployment.

#### Sub Practices

2. Conduct workshops, interviews, and surveys to understand their perspectives on the system's effectiveness, its impact on individuals and society, and any potential risks or concerns.

3. Document their feedback and input to inform the assessment of performance improvements or declines.

### Measure 4.3.3. Identify and Correlate Risks and Trustworthiness Characteristics.

Analyzing field data in conjunction with insights gathered from consultations with AI actors allows for the identification of potential correlations between changes in the AI system's performance and specific context-relevant risks or trustworthiness characteristics. By closely examining these relationships, organizations can uncover how variations in performance metrics might be linked to particular aspects of the system's design, implementation, or operational environment. This analysis is pivotal in understanding the multifaceted nature of AI system performance and trustworthiness, providing a foundation for targeted improvements and risk mitigation strategies.

Exploring these correlations further helps in hypothesizing about the underlying factors that contribute to performance improvements or declines. By delving into the nuances of how certain design choices, implementation details, or deployment conditions may impact the system's effectiveness and reliability, organizations can develop informed hypotheses. These hypotheses serve as a basis for further investigation and testing, guiding efforts to enhance the AI system's trustworthiness and performance in a way that is sensitive to the unique characteristics of each deployment context.

#### Sub Practices

1. Analyze field data and consultations with AI actors to identify potential correlations between changes in performance and specific context-relevant risks or trustworthiness characteristics.

2. Explore these correlations to understand how specific aspects of the AI system's design, implementation, or deployment may influence its performance and trustworthiness.

3. Develop hypotheses about the factors that contribute to performance improvements or declines.

### Measure 4.3.4. Document Measurable Performance Changes.

Maintaining a comprehensive record of measurable performance changes is vital for understanding the evolution of an AI system's effectiveness and reliability. This documentation should detail the specific metrics that have been affected, quantify the magnitude of these changes, and outline the time frames over which they occurred. By systematically recording this information, organizations can track the AI system's performance trajectory, making it easier to identify patterns, assess the impact of implemented changes, and make data-driven decisions for future improvements.

Documenting the findings from analyzing correlations between performance changes and context-relevant risks or trustworthiness characteristics further enriches this record, providing insights into the underlying factors influencing the AI system's performance. Sharing this comprehensive documentation with relevant stakeholders, including AI developers, operators, and end-users, is crucial for fostering an environment of transparency and accountability. It not only demonstrates the organization's commitment to continuous improvement but also engages stakeholders in the process of enhancing the AI system, ensuring that it remains aligned with user needs and expectations.

### Measure 4.3.5. Continuously Monitor and Adapt Performance Monitoring.

Regular monitoring of field data and consultations with AI actors is crucial for staying abreast of new trends, patterns, and emerging risks that may influence the performance of AI systems. This ongoing surveillance allows organizations to detect shifts in system performance or user interaction early, enabling timely adjustments to address potential issues. By keeping a finger on the pulse of how AI systems operate in real-world conditions and how they are perceived by users, organizations can proactively manage risks and ensure that AI systems continue to meet performance standards and user expectations.

Adapting data collection and analysis methodologies in response to emerging trends is essential for maintaining an accurate and nuanced understanding of AI system performance. As new patterns are identified and the operational context evolves, refining these methodologies ensures that performance monitoring remains effective and relevant. Additionally, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement in performance monitoring encourages all stakeholders involved in the AI lifecycle to contribute to and engage with the process of optimizing AI system performance. This culture not only promotes excellence in AI development and deployment but also ensures that AI systems remain effective and trustworthy over time.
