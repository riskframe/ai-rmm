## Measure 1.2
> Appropriateness of AI metrics and effectiveness of existing controls are regularly assessed and updated, including reports of errors and potential impacts on affected communities. [@playbook]

### Measure 1.2.1. Regularly Evaluate Measurement Approach Relevance.

Assessing the relevance of the measurement approach involves regularly reviewing and analyzing its alignment with the evolving landscape of AI risks and the changing needs of stakeholders. This process requires continuous monitoring of industry trends, advancements in AI technology, and emerging regulatory requirements to ensure that the measurement approach remains effective and adaptable to new challenges. Additionally, soliciting feedback from stakeholders and experts helps to identify areas where the measurement approach may need adjustment or enhancement to better address the diverse range of AI risks and their potential impacts on affected communities.

This practice requires evaluating the relevance of measurement approaches and involves periodically reviewing their effectiveness and adapting them to reflect changes in AI systems and contextual factors. This includes assessing the capability of existing metrics to address emerging risks and recognizing any gaps or constraints in the current approach, prompting adjustments or enhancements as necessary to maintain alignment with evolving needs and challenges.

#### Sub Practices

1. Periodically assess the continued relevance of the selected measurement approaches and metrics in light of the AI system's evolution and changing context.

2. Evaluate the ability of existing metrics to capture the evolving nature of AI risks and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

3. Identify potential blind spots or limitations in the current measurement approach and consider incorporating new metrics or methodologies.

### Measure 1.2.2. Analyze Error Reports and Identify Impacts.

Examining error reports and identifying impacts involves systematically reviewing and analyzing reported errors or incidents within the AI system to understand their causes and potential consequences. This process requires thorough investigation to determine the scope and severity of the impacts on affected communities or stakeholders. By identifying and documenting these impacts, organizations can gain valuable insights into areas for improvement, inform decision-making processes, and enhance the overall trustworthiness of the AI system.

Reviewing error reports and identifying impacts involves establishing robust mechanisms for error tracking and analysis, facilitating ongoing monitoring and investigation of reported incidents. Analyzing patterns and trends in error data enables the identification of potential impacts on affected communities, informing proactive measures to address issues and enhance the AI system's reliability and trustworthiness over time.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a mechanism for collecting, analyzing, and tracking reports of AI errors, biases, or unintended consequences.

2. Analyze error reports to identify patterns, trends, and potential impacts on affected communities.

3. Proactively investigate and address reported errors to minimize their negative impact and refine the AI system's performance and trustworthiness.

### Measure 1.2.3. Assess Effectiveness of Existing Controls.

Evaluating the performance of current controls encompasses systematic reviews to gauge their capacity in mitigating AI-related risks and preventing adverse effects on impacted communities. This involves scrutinizing control mechanisms, assessing their effectiveness in managing identified risks, and pinpointing opportunities for enhancement. Regular evaluations of control efficacy enable organizations to maintain resilient risk management approaches, adept at addressing dynamic AI challenges and societal implications.

Regular evaluations of control efficacy enable organizations to maintain resilient risk management approaches, adept at addressing dynamic AI challenges and societal implications.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of existing controls in mitigating AI risks and preventing errors or unintended consequences.

2. Analyze data collected through measurement processes to assess the effectiveness of controls in addressing identified risks.

3. Identify areas where existing controls may be insufficient or ineffective and consider implementing additional or enhanced mitigation strategies.

### Measure 1.2.4. Integrate Evaluation Findings into Risk Management.

Incorporating evaluation outcomes into risk management entails integrating insights gleaned from assessments of AI metrics and control effectiveness into overarching risk mitigation strategies. This process involves synthesizing evaluation findings, identifying emerging patterns or trends in AI performance and risk exposure, and adjusting risk management approaches accordingly. By integrating evaluation outcomes into risk management practices, organizations can enhance their ability to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate AI-related risks, thereby bolstering the trustworthiness and resilience of AI systems.

involves integrating insights garnered from assessments of AI metrics and control effectiveness into overarching risk mitigation strategies. Using the insights gained to update risk assessments, prioritize mitigation efforts, and refine risk management strategies is essential for adapting to evolving risks and improving the overall trustworthiness of AI systems. Additionally, communicating evaluation findings to relevant stakeholders promotes transparency and accountability in AI governance, fostering trust and informed decision-making.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate the findings from measurement evaluations and error reports into the AI system's risk management process.

2. Use the insights gained to update risk assessments, prioritize mitigation efforts, and refine risk management strategies.

3. Communicate evaluation findings to relevant stakeholders to promote transparency and accountability in AI governance.

### Measure 1.2.5. Continuously Improve Measurement and Control Strategies.

Refining measurement and control strategies entails iteratively enhancing the approaches used to assess AI metrics and evaluate the effectiveness of existing controls. This iterative process includes analyzing feedback from error reports, assessing the performance of implemented controls, and identifying areas for enhancement. 

This practice requires fostering a culture of ongoing improvement, gathering feedback from stakeholders and experts, and adapting processes and metrics to align with emerging risk profiles and evolving AI system landscapes.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain a culture of continuous improvement by regularly evaluating and refining measurement approaches and control strategies.

2. Gather feedback from stakeholders, experts, and data analysts to identify areas for improvement and emerging risk profiles.

3. Adapt measurement processes, metrics, and control mechanisms based on the evaluation findings and evolving AI system landscape.
