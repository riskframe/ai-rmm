## Map 1.4
> The business value or context of business use has been clearly defined or – in the case of assessing existing AI systems – re-evaluated. [@playbook]

### Map 1.4.1. Clearly Define the Business Value of AI Systems.

The practice aims to articulate the specific contributions and benefits that AI systems offer to the business context. It involves a comprehensive understanding of how AI solutions align with strategic objectives, improve efficiency, enhance decision-making processes, and deliver tangible value to stakeholders. By clearly defining the business value of AI systems, organizations can ensure alignment between technological investments and overarching business goals, facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation.

Identifying and articulating the specific business value that AI systems are expected to deliver involves quantifying anticipated benefits and ensuring alignment with organizational goals. This includes improving efficiency, productivity, innovation, and customer satisfaction, with measurable metrics like cost savings, revenue growth, or risk reduction guiding expectations. It's essential to ensure that these expectations align with the organization's mission, goals, and available resources to drive informed decision-making and maximize value realization.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify and articulate the specific business value that AI systems are expected to deliver, including improved efficiency, productivity, innovation, and customer satisfaction.

2. Quantify the anticipated business benefits in terms of measurable metrics, such as cost savings, revenue growth, or reduced risk.

3. Ensure that business value expectations are aligned with the organization's mission, goals, and resources.

### Map 1.4.2. Assess the Context of Business Use.

Assessing the context of business use involves understanding the specific environment, challenges, and opportunities within which AI systems operate. This assessment encompasses factors such as industry regulations, market dynamics, customer expectations, and technological advancements. By analyzing the context of business use, organizations can identify potential risks, constraints, and dependencies that may impact the effectiveness and value proposition of AI solutions. Additionally, it enables stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the deployment, optimization, and scaling of AI systems to better align with business objectives and address evolving needs.

Analyzing the specific use cases and scenarios where AI systems will be deployed is crucial for understanding their operational context and potential impact. By considering factors such as the target user base, technical infrastructure, and system interactions, organizations can better identify opportunities and challenges. This analysis facilitates the alignment of AI solutions with business objectives and helps mitigate risks associated with deployment.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the specific use cases and scenarios where AI systems will be deployed.

2. Consider the operational context, including the target user base, technical infrastructure, and potential interactions with other systems.

3. Identify any potential challenges or risks associated with the business context and how AI systems can address them.

### Map 1.4.3. Re-Evaluate the Business Value of Existing AI Systems.

To ensure ongoing alignment with organizational goals and evolving business needs, it's essential to periodically reassess the business value of existing AI systems. This involves revisiting the original objectives and use cases of AI implementations and evaluating their actual performance and impact against expected outcomes. By re-evaluating the business value of existing AI systems, organizations can identify areas for improvement, reallocate resources effectively, and optimize the contribution of AI technology to overall business objectives.

Assessing the ongoing relevance and effectiveness of existing AI systems involves periodically reviewing their alignment with organizational goals and evaluating their performance against expected outcomes. This entails analyzing how well AI systems are delivering value, considering current organizational needs and priorities, and identifying opportunities for enhancement or replacement to optimize their contribution to business objectives.

#### Sub Practices

1. For existing AI systems, conduct a periodic review to assess their continued relevance and contribution to the organization's business objectives.

2. Evaluate how effectively AI systems are delivering their intended value and whether they still align with the organization's current needs and priorities.

3. Identify any areas where AI systems can be enhanced or replaced to improve their effectiveness and business value.

### Map 1.4.4. Document Business Value and Use Case Analysis.

To effectively manage AI systems, it's essential to document thorough analyses of their business value and use cases. This documentation should encompass a detailed understanding of how AI contributes to business objectives, including efficiency improvements, cost savings, revenue generation, and customer satisfaction enhancements. Additionally, the analysis should outline specific use cases where AI is applied, considering factors such as target user base, technical requirements, and potential impact on operations. By documenting this information, organizations can ensure clarity, alignment, and informed decision-making regarding AI implementation and optimization strategies.

Documenting the business value and use cases of AI systems involves creating comprehensive documentation that outlines their contributions, contextual use, and effectiveness analysis. This documentation should be shared with relevant stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making and alignment across teams. Regularly reviewing and updating this documentation ensures its relevance and accuracy as AI systems evolve and the business context shifts.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that clearly outlines the business value of AI systems, the context of their use, and the analysis of their effectiveness.

2. Share this documentation with all relevant stakeholders, including AI developers, business leaders, and risk managers.

3. Regularly review and update the documentation as AI systems evolve and the business context changes.

### Map 1.4.5. Use Business Value Evaluation for Decision-Making.

Utilize the evaluation of business value as a cornerstone for decision-making processes regarding AI systems. By leveraging insights gained from assessing the alignment between AI solutions and business objectives, organizations can make informed decisions regarding investment prioritization, resource allocation, and strategic planning. This approach ensures that technological investments are in line with overarching business goals, optimizing the utilization of resources and maximizing the value derived from AI implementations.

Integrating the assessment of business value into decision-making processes for AI projects and initiatives is crucial for prioritizing efforts and maximizing impact. By prioritizing projects demonstrating clear business value and alignment with strategic objectives, organizations can ensure efficient resource allocation and focus on initiatives with the highest potential for success. Additionally, leveraging business value metrics for evaluating AI systems allows for continuous improvement efforts, ensuring that projects remain aligned with evolving business needs and objectives.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate the assessment of business value into the decision-making process for AI projects and initiatives.

2. Prioritize projects that demonstrate clear business value and alignment with the organization's strategic objectives.

3. Use business value metrics to evaluate the success of AI systems and inform ongoing improvements.
