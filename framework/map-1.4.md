## Map 1.4: The business value or context of business use has been clearly defined or – in the case of assessing existing AI systems – re-evaluated.

### Map 1.4.1. Clearly Define the Business Value of AI Systems.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify and articulate the specific business value that AI systems are expected to deliver, including improved efficiency, productivity, innovation, and customer satisfaction.

2. Quantify the anticipated business benefits in terms of measurable metrics, such as cost savings, revenue growth, or reduced risk.

3. Ensure that business value expectations are aligned with the organization's mission, goals, and resources.

### Map 1.4.2. Assess the Context of Business Use.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the specific use cases and scenarios where AI systems will be deployed.

2. Consider the operational context, including the target user base, technical infrastructure, and potential interactions with other systems.

3. Identify any potential challenges or risks associated with the business context and how AI systems can address them.

### Map 1.4.3. Re-Evaluate the Business Value of Existing AI Systems.

#### Sub Practices

1. For existing AI systems, conduct a periodic review to assess their continued relevance and contribution to the organization's business objectives.

2. Evaluate how effectively AI systems are delivering their intended value and whether they still align with the organization's current needs and priorities.

3. Identify any areas where AI systems can be enhanced or replaced to improve their effectiveness and business value.

### Map 1.4.4. Document Business Value and Use Case Analysis.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that clearly outlines the business value of AI systems, the context of their use, and the analysis of their effectiveness.

2. Share this documentation with all relevant stakeholders, including AI developers, business leaders, and risk managers.

3. Regularly review and update the documentation as AI systems evolve and the business context changes.

### Map 1.4.5. Use Business Value Evaluation for Decision-Making.

#### Sub Practices

1. Integrate the assessment of business value into the decision-making process for AI projects and initiatives.

2. Prioritize projects that demonstrate clear business value and alignment with the organization's strategic objectives.

3. Use business value metrics to evaluate the success of AI systems and inform ongoing improvements.
