## Map 5.2: Practices and personnel for supporting regular engagement with relevant AI actors and integrating feedback about positive, negative, and unanticipated impacts are in place and documented.

### Map 5.2.1. Establish a Mechanism for Regular Engagement.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement a structured mechanism for regular engagement with relevant AI actors, including stakeholders, users, experts, and researchers.

2. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams responsible for facilitating and maintaining these interactions.

3. Define clear guidelines for communication channels, frequency of interactions, and the format for exchanging feedback.

### 5.2.2. Solicit Feedback on Positive and Negative Impacts.

#### Sub Practices

1. Actively seek feedback from relevant AI actors regarding the AI system's positive impacts, including benefits, improvements, and unintended positive consequences.

2. Proactively invite feedback on potential negative impacts, including ethical concerns, unintended consequences, and potential harm to individuals or society.

3. Provide clear channels for stakeholders to report unanticipated impacts, allowing for timely identification and mitigation.

### 5.2.3. Integrate Feedback into AI System Enhancements.

#### Sub Practices

1. Analyze and synthesize feedback from relevant AI actors to identify areas for improvement and potential risks to address.

2. Prioritize feedback based on its significance, relevance, and potential impact on the AI system's performance, trustworthiness, and ethical considerations.

3. Integrate the insights gained from feedback into the AI system's development lifecycle, including design, implementation, and deployment phases.

### 5.2.4. Document Feedback Mechanisms and Integration.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation outlining the established mechanisms for regular engagement, feedback collection, and integration strategies.

2. Describe the process for prioritizing, analyzing, and responding to feedback from relevant AI actors.

3. Establish a mechanism for tracking feedback implementation and measuring its impact on the AI system's performance and trustworthiness.

### 5.2.5. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Engagement Practices.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of engagement practices and feedback mechanisms to ensure they are meeting the needs of relevant AI actors.

2. Gather feedback from stakeholders on the quality of engagement, the timeliness of feedback responses, and the impact of feedback on the AI system.

3. Adapt engagement strategies and feedback integration processes based on the evaluation findings and emerging feedback patterns.
