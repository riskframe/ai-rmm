# Map 5: Impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society are characterized.

## Map 5.1: Likelihood and magnitude of each identified impact (both potentially beneficial and harmful) based on expected use, past uses of AI systems in similar contexts, public incident reports, feedback from those external to the team that developed or deployed the AI system, or other data are identified and documented.

### Map 5.1.1. Identify Potential Impacts.

#### Sub Practices

1. Thoroughly evaluate the potential impacts of the AI system, both beneficial and harmful, considering all stakeholders and potential use cases.

2. Assess potential impacts across a range of dimensions, including social, economic, environmental, and ethical considerations.

3. Document the identified impacts in a clear and structured format, ensuring they are clearly categorized and distinguished.

### Map 5.1.2. Assess Likelihood and Magnitude.

#### Sub Practices

1. For each identified impact, assess the likelihood of its occurrence, considering factors such as the design of the AI system, the context of its deployment, and potential misuse scenarios.

2. Assess the magnitude of each impact, evaluating its potential severity and potential impact on individuals, organizations, and society.

3. Use appropriate methods and tools to quantify the likelihood and magnitude of impacts, such as risk assessment frameworks or impact modeling techniques.

### Map 5.1.3. Consider Past Experiences and External Feedback.

#### Sub Practices

1. Analyze past uses of AI systems in similar contexts to identify potential risks and opportunities associated with the AI system's deployment.

2. Review public incident reports and research findings related to AI systems to gain insights into potential challenges and unintended consequences.

3. Gather feedback from stakeholders, including experts, users, and potential beneficiaries, to understand their perspectives and concerns about the AI system's impacts.

### Map 5.1.4. Document Impact Likelihood and Magnitude.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the identified impacts, their likelihood, their magnitude, and the rationale behind the assessment.

2. Present the impact assessment findings in a structured and easy-to-understand format, using visualizations or tables to illustrate the key findings.

3. Ensure that the documentation is accessible to relevant stakeholders and facilitates informed decision-making about the AI system's development and deployment.

### Map 5.1.5. Continuously Monitor and Update Impact Assessment.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and update the impact assessment as the AI system evolves, its use cases expand, and new information becomes available.

2. Incorporate feedback from users, stakeholders, and researchers to refine the assessment and identify emerging risks or opportunities.

3. Maintain a living document that reflects the dynamic nature of the AI system's impacts and serves as an ongoing resource for responsible AI development.
