# Map 3: AI capabilities, targeted usage, goals, and expected benefits and costs compared with appropriate benchmarks are understood.

## Map 3.1: Potential benefits of intended AI system functionality and performance are examined and documented.

### Map 3.1.1. Identify and Evaluate Intended Benefits.

To effectively understand the potential benefits of an intended AI system, it's essential to identify and evaluate them comprehensively. This involves examining how the AI system's functionality and performance align with the organization's goals and objectives, as well as assessing the expected positive outcomes it aims to achieve. Through careful analysis and documentation, potential benefits such as increased efficiency, accuracy, productivity, and innovation can be identified, providing valuable insights into the value proposition of the AI system and its potential impact on the organization's operations and strategic direction.

Evaluating the potential benefits of an intended AI system involves clearly defining the specific benefits it aims to deliver, quantitatively measuring improvements in efficiency, productivity, or customer satisfaction, and qualitatively assessing enhanced decision-making, fairness, and risk reduction.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly define the specific benefits that the AI system is expected to deliver for its intended users, organizations, and society.

2. Quantitatively measure the potential benefits in terms of improved efficiency, productivity, revenue, or customer satisfaction.

3. Qualitatively assess the potential benefits in terms of enhanced decision-making, improved fairness, and reduced risk.

### Map 3.1.2. Document Potential Benefits and Their Justifications.

To effectively capture the potential benefits of an intended AI system, it's crucial to thoroughly document these advantages along with their justifications. This documentation should provide a clear and detailed explanation of each identified benefit, including how it aligns with organizational goals, addresses user needs, or enhances overall performance. Additionally, it should outline the rationale behind each benefit, detailing the evidence, analysis, or reasoning used to support its inclusion in the evaluation. By documenting potential benefits and their justifications comprehensively, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of the expected value proposition offered by the AI system, facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation throughout the project lifecycle.

Documenting the potential benefits of an AI system involves creating comprehensive documentation outlining these advantages and providing justifications for their projections. Ensuring clarity, conciseness, and accessibility to relevant stakeholders is essential in facilitating understanding and informed decision-making regarding the anticipated benefits of the AI system.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the potential benefits of the AI system.

2. Provide justifications for the expected benefits, explaining the rationale behind their projections.

3. Ensure that documentation is clear, concise, and accessible to relevant stakeholders.

### Map 3.1.3. Prioritize Benefits Based on Organizational Priorities.

To prioritize benefits based on organizational priorities, it's essential to assess and align the potential benefits of the AI system with the overarching goals and strategic objectives of the organization. This involves understanding the specific needs, preferences, and constraints of the organization, as well as considering factors such as budgetary constraints, resource availability, and risk tolerance levels. By prioritizing benefits in line with organizational priorities, decision-makers can allocate resources effectively and maximize the value derived from the AI system implementation, ensuring that it delivers the most significant impact in areas deemed critical by the organization.

Aligning the identified benefits with the organization's overall mission, goals, and strategic objectives is crucial in prioritizing benefits based on organizational priorities. This involves assessing the relevance and potential impact of each benefit in contributing to the organization's success. Utilizing a structured prioritization framework facilitates informed decision-making regarding resource allocation and focus, ensuring that efforts are directed towards realizing the most significant benefits aligned with the organization's strategic direction and objectives.

#### Sub Practices

1. Align the identified benefits with the organization's overall mission, goals, and strategic objectives.

2. Prioritize benefits that are most relevant to the organization's priorities and have the greatest potential to impact its success.

3. Use a structured prioritization framework to make informed decisions about resource allocation and focus.

### Map 3.1.4. Communicate Potential Benefits to Stakeholders.

To effectively communicate potential benefits to stakeholders, it's essential to craft clear and compelling messages that highlight how the AI system's functionality and performance align with their interests and objectives. Utilizing appropriate channels and formats tailored to the preferences of different stakeholders ensures maximum engagement and understanding. Providing concrete examples and case studies illustrating the potential impact of the AI system can further enhance stakeholder buy-in and support. Additionally, fostering an open dialogue allows stakeholders to ask questions, express concerns, and provide valuable feedback, ultimately strengthening alignment and collaboration throughout the AI project lifecycle.

Highlighting the potential benefits of the AI system to stakeholders involves proactively communicating its advantages, employing clear messaging to showcase value, and engaging stakeholders in discussions about alignment with their interests and objectives.

#### Sub Practices

1. Proactively communicate the potential benefits of the AI system to stakeholders, including decision-makers, investors, and potential users.

2. Use clear and compelling messaging to showcase the value proposition and demonstrate the organization's commitment to responsible AI development.

3. Engage stakeholders in discussions about the benefits and how they align with their own interests and objectives.

### Map 3.1.5. Monitor and Evaluate Actual Benefits.

Continuously monitoring and evaluating actual benefits entails assessing the realized impact of the AI system's functionality and performance against initial projections and expectations. This involves collecting relevant data, analyzing outcomes, and comparing them with predefined benchmarks or goals. By doing so, organizations can gain insights into the effectiveness of the AI system, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions to optimize its usage and maximize benefits over time.

Continuously monitoring and evaluating actual benefits involves establishing mechanisms for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and gathering user feedback, allowing organizations to assess the effectiveness of the AI system in delivering intended benefits. Utilizing this data facilitates ongoing refinement of the AI system and identification of areas for improvement, ensuring its continued alignment with organizational goals and priorities.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the actual benefits realized from the AI system's deployment.

2. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) and gather feedback from users to assess the effectiveness of the AI system.

3. Use the gathered data to refine the AI system and identify areas for improvement.
