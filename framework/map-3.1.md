# Map 3: AI capabilities, targeted usage, goals, and expected benefits and costs compared with appropriate benchmarks are understood.

## Map 3.1: Potential benefits of intended AI system functionality and performance are examined and documented.

### Map 3.1.1. Identify and Evaluate Intended Benefits.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly define the specific benefits that the AI system is expected to deliver for its intended users, organizations, and society.

2. Quantitatively measure the potential benefits in terms of improved efficiency, productivity, revenue, or customer satisfaction.

3. Qualitatively assess the potential benefits in terms of enhanced decision-making, improved fairness, and reduced risk.

### Map 3.1.2. Document Potential Benefits and Their Justifications.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the potential benefits of the AI system.

2. Provide justifications for the expected benefits, explaining the rationale behind their projections.

3. Ensure that documentation is clear, concise, and accessible to relevant stakeholders.

### Map 3.1.3. Prioritize Benefits Based on Organizational Priorities.

#### Sub Practices

1. Align the identified benefits with the organization's overall mission, goals, and strategic objectives.

2. Prioritize benefits that are most relevant to the organization's priorities and have the greatest potential to impact its success.

3. Use a structured prioritization framework to make informed decisions about resource allocation and focus.

### Map 3.1.4. Communicate Potential Benefits to Stakeholders.

#### Sub Practices

1. Proactively communicate the potential benefits of the AI system to stakeholders, including decision-makers, investors, and potential users.

2. Use clear and compelling messaging to showcase the value proposition and demonstrate the organization's commitment to responsible AI development.

3. Engage stakeholders in discussions about the benefits and how they align with their own interests and objectives.

### Map 3.1.5. Monitor and Evaluate Actual Benefits.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the actual benefits realized from the AI system's deployment.

2. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) and gather feedback from users to assess the effectiveness of the AI system.

3. Use the gathered data to refine the AI system and identify areas for improvement.
