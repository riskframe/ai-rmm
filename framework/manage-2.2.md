## Manage 2.2: Mechanisms are in place and applied to sustain the value of deployed AI systems.

### Manage 2.2.1. Establish Ongoing Monitoring and Evaluation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement continuous monitoring mechanisms to track the performance, effectiveness, and trustworthiness of deployed AI systems.

2. Collect and analyze data from various sources, including system logs, user feedback, and performance metrics, to identify potential issues or areas for improvement.

3. Regularly evaluate the AI system's performance against its intended objectives and the evolving needs of users and stakeholders.

### Manage 2.2.2. Implement Automated Maintenance and Updates.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement automated maintenance procedures to ensure that deployed AI systems remain updated with the latest software patches, security fixes, and performance enhancements.

2. Automate updates to AI models, algorithms, and data sets to maintain the system's accuracy, fairness, and robustness.

3. Establish clear policies and procedures for managing and deploying AI updates to minimize disruptions and ensure system stability.

### Manage 2.2.3. Conduct Regular Testing and Validation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement a regular testing and validation process to ensure that deployed AI systems continue to meet the required performance, accuracy, and fairness standards.

2. Conduct both functional and non-functional testing to evaluate the system's ability to perform its intended tasks and to identify potential biases or vulnerabilities.

3. Leverage automated testing tools and techniques to streamline the testing process and improve efficiency.

### Manage 2.2.4. Address Performance Issues Proactively.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish clear escalation procedures to promptly address performance issues or anomalies detected in deployed AI systems.

2. Prioritize investigations and implement mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of performance issues on user experience and system reliability.

3. Document performance incidents, root causes, and corrective actions taken to enable continuous improvement and prevent recurrence.

### Manage 2.2.5. Facilitate Data Quality Management.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement data quality management practices to ensure that the data used to train and operate AI systems is accurate, complete, and relevant.

2. Establish data governance policies and procedures to maintain data quality and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

3. Invest in data cleaning, preprocessing, and validation techniques to enhance data quality and minimize the impact of data errors on AI performance.

### Manage 2.2.6. Promote Stakeholder Involvement and Feedback.

#### Sub Practices

1. Encourage ongoing engagement with stakeholders, including AI developers, operators, users, and affected communities, to gather feedback on the performance and effectiveness of deployed AI systems.

2. Utilize feedback to identify areas for improvement, address user concerns, and ensure that the AI system aligns with the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

3. Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration to facilitate continuous improvement and user-centric AI development.

### Manage 2.2.7. Adapt to Evolving Needs and Technological Advancements.

#### Sub Practices

1. Continuously monitor and assess the evolving needs of users, stakeholders, and the broader environment in which AI systems operate.

2. Adapt AI systems to incorporate new capabilities, features, and functionalities to meet emerging requirements and maintain its relevance.

3. Stay abreast of technological advancements in AI, data science, and related fields to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.
