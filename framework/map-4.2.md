## Map 4.2: Internal risk controls for components of the AI system, including third-party AI technologies, are identified and documented.

### Map 4.2.1. Identify and Assess Internal Risks for AI Components.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct a thorough assessment of potential internal risks associated with the AI system's components, including third-party AI technologies.

2. Evaluate vulnerabilities in AI algorithms, software, and data sources that could lead to security breaches, data integrity issues, or malfunctioning AI systems.

3. Assess the potential impact of internal risks on the overall security, reliability, and performance of the AI system.

### Map 4.2.2. Define and Document Internal Risk Control Measures.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement internal risk control measures to mitigate the identified risks and protect the AI system from potential harm.

2. Implement security controls, such as access controls, encryption, and anomaly detection, to protect data and systems from unauthorized access or manipulation.

3. Establish processes for quality assurance, testing, and validation to ensure the reliability and performance of AI components.

### Map 4.2.3. Integrate Internal Risk Control Measures into System Development.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate internal risk control measures into the AI system's development lifecycle, from design and implementation to testing and deployment.

2. Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

3. Implement continuous monitoring and auditing mechanisms to detect and respond to emerging risks promptly.

### Map 4.2.4. Document Internal Risk Control Implementation and Effectiveness.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the implemented internal risk control measures, their rationale, and the process for ongoing evaluation.

2. Track the effectiveness of risk control measures through regular audits, incident reports, and feedback from users and stakeholders.

3. Adapt and refine risk control measures as the AI system evolves and new risks emerge.

### Map 4.2.5. Maintain a Culture of Security and Risk Management.

#### Sub Practices

1. Foster a culture of security and risk management within the organization, emphasizing the importance of protecting AI systems and data.

2. Provide training and awareness programs for AI developers, operators, and users to enhance their understanding of security principles and risk management practices.

3. Establish clear accountability and reporting mechanisms for addressing security incidents and ensuring compliance with internal security policies.
