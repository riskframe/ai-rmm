3. Document these gaps and shortcomings in a clear and concise manner.

### Manage 1.1.3. Engage with Stakeholders for Feedback and Validation.

Engage with stakeholders to gather feedback and validate whether the AI system aligns with its intended purposes and stated objectives. This interaction allows stakeholders to provide valuable insights into the system's functionality, usability, and overall effectiveness. By actively involving stakeholders in the validation process, organizations can ensure that the AI system meets their needs and expectations, ultimately informing decisions regarding its development or deployment.

Engaging with relevant stakeholders, including AI developers, operators, decision-makers, and potential users, is crucial for gathering feedback on the AI system's alignment with intended purposes and objectives. By soliciting their perspectives on the system's effectiveness, potential risks, and opportunities for improvement, organizations can gain valuable insights into its performance and impact. Documenting stakeholder feedback and incorporating it into the evaluation process ensures a comprehensive assessment of the AI system's suitability and informs decision-making regarding its development or deployment.

#### Sub Practices

1. Engage with relevant stakeholders, including AI developers, operators, decision-makers, and potential users, to gather their feedback on the AI system's alignment with intended purposes and objectives.

2. Solicit their perspectives on the system's effectiveness, potential risks, and opportunities for improvement.

3. Document stakeholder feedback and incorporate it into the evaluation process.

### Manage 1.1.4. Evaluate Tradeoffs and Constraints.

To effectively assess whether the development or deployment of an AI system should proceed, it's essential to evaluate the tradeoffs and constraints associated with its intended purposes and stated objectives. This involves analyzing factors such as resource limitations, technical constraints, ethical considerations, and potential societal impacts. By carefully weighing these tradeoffs and constraints, organizations can make informed decisions about the feasibility and desirability of advancing the AI system, ensuring alignment with broader strategic goals and ethical principles.

Assessing the tradeoffs and constraints linked to the development and deployment of the AI system involves evaluating various factors such as cost, technical feasibility, and ethical considerations. By identifying potential risks and challenges throughout the system's lifecycle, organizations can proactively develop mitigation strategies to address these issues, ensuring smoother development and deployment processes while maintaining alignment with ethical standards and strategic objectives.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the tradeoffs and constraints associated with the AI system's development and deployment, considering factors such as cost, technical feasibility, and ethical considerations.

2. Identify potential risks and challenges that may arise during the AI system's lifecycle.

3. Develop mitigation strategies to address these risks and challenges.

### Manage 1.1.5. Make Informed Decisions and Document Rationale.

To make informed decisions regarding the advancement of AI system development or deployment, it's crucial to thoroughly assess whether the system aligns with its intended purposes and objectives. This involves considering various factors such as performance metrics, stakeholder feedback, and risk assessments. Documenting the rationale behind these decisions ensures transparency and accountability, facilitating clear communication among stakeholders and aiding in future reviews or audits.

Considering various factors such as alignment, stakeholder feedback, and constraints, an informed decision is made regarding whether to proceed with the AI system's development or deployment. Documenting the rationale behind the decision, including considerations like tradeoffs and gaps, ensures transparency and accountability. Sharing this documentation with stakeholders fosters clear communication and understanding of the decision-making process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Based on the assessment of alignment, gaps, stakeholder feedback, tradeoffs, and constraints, make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the AI system's development or deployment.

2. Document the rationale behind the decision, clearly outlining the considerations that led to the decision.

3. Share the decision documentation with relevant stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Manage 1.1.6. Establish Governance Mechanisms.

Establishing governance mechanisms involves setting up structured processes and frameworks to oversee the determination of whether the AI system fulfills its intended purposes and objectives, and if its development or deployment should continue. These mechanisms ensure accountability, transparency, and compliance with relevant policies and regulations. By defining roles, responsibilities, and decision-making procedures, governance mechanisms facilitate effective management of AI risks and help align the development and deployment processes with organizational goals and values.

Establishing clear governance mechanisms is essential for overseeing the ongoing development, deployment, and operation of the AI system, ensuring its alignment with intended purposes and objectives.
