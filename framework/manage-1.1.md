# Manage 1: AI risks based on assessments and other analytical output from the MAP and MEASURE functions are prioritized, responded to, and managed

## Manage 1.1: A determination is made as to whether the AI system achieves its intended purposes and stated objectives and whether its development or deployment should proceed.

### Manage 1.1.1. Assess Alignment with Intended Purposes and Objectives.

#### Sub Practices

1. Clearly define the AI system's intended purposes and stated objectives, ensuring that they are well-understood by all stakeholders.

2. Evaluate whether the AI system's design, implementation, and deployment align with these intended purposes and stated objectives.

3. Identify any gaps or inconsistencies between the AI system's capabilities and the desired outcomes.

### Manage 1.1.2. Conduct Requirements Analysis and Gap Analysis.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct a comprehensive requirements analysis to identify all the functional and non-functional requirements for the AI system.

2. Compare the identified requirements against the AI system's actual capabilities and performance to identify any gaps or shortcomings.

3. Document these gaps and shortcomings in a clear and concise manner.

### Manage 1.1.3. Engage with Stakeholders for Feedback and Validation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Engage with relevant stakeholders, including AI developers, operators, decision-makers, and potential users, to gather their feedback on the AI system's alignment with intended purposes and objectives.

2. Solicit their perspectives on the system's effectiveness, potential risks, and opportunities for improvement.

3. Document stakeholder feedback and incorporate it into the evaluation process.

### Manage 1.1.4. Evaluate Tradeoffs and Constraints.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the tradeoffs and constraints associated with the AI system's development and deployment, considering factors such as cost, technical feasibility, and ethical considerations.

2. Identify potential risks and challenges that may arise during the AI system's lifecycle.

3. Develop mitigation strategies to address these risks and challenges.

### Manage 1.1.5. Make Informed Decisions and Document Rationale.

#### Sub Practices

1. Based on the assessment of alignment, gaps, stakeholder feedback, tradeoffs, and constraints, make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the AI system's development or deployment.

2. Document the rationale behind the decision, clearly outlining the considerations that led to the decision.

3. Share the decision documentation with relevant stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Manage 1.1.6. Establish Governance Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish clear governance mechanisms to oversee the AI system's development, deployment, and operation, ensuring that it continues to align with intended purposes and objectives.

2. Define roles and responsibilities for monitoring, evaluating, and making adjustments to the AI system as needed.

3. Integrate governance mechanisms into organizational policies, procedures, and frameworks.

### Manage 1.1.7. Continuously Monitor and Adapt.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly monitor the AI system's performance and alignment with intended purposes and objectives throughout its lifecycle.

2. Adapt the AI system based on feedback, new requirements, and evolving circumstances.

3. Foster a culture of continuous improvement and responsiveness to stakeholder needs.
