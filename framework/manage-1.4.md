## Manage 1.4: Negative residual risks (defined as the sum of all unmitigated risks) to both downstream acquirers of AI systems and end users are documented.

### Manage 1.4.1. Identify and Quantify Residual Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify all unmitigated AI risks that remain after implementing risk mitigation strategies.

2. Quantify the residual risks using appropriate risk assessment methodologies, such as risk matrices or numerical scoring systems.

3. Understand the potential impact of each residual risk on downstream acquirers of AI systems and end users.

### Manage 1.4.2. Document Residual Risks for Downstream Acquirers.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create a comprehensive document that outlines the identified residual risks and their potential impact on downstream acquirers.

2. The document should include details about the risk type, its likelihood, its potential impact, and the mitigation strategies that were considered.

3. Share this document with downstream acquirers to inform their risk assessments and decision-making processes.

### Manage 1.4.3. Document Residual Risks for End Users.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop clear and concise documentation of residual risks that may affect end users of the AI system.

2. This documentation should include a summary of the risk, its potential impact, and the steps that have been taken to mitigate the risk.

3. Communicate these residual risks to end users through appropriate channels, such as user manuals, training materials, or privacy policies.

### Manage 1.4.4. Establish Communication Channels with Downstream Acquirers and End Users.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain open and transparent communication channels with downstream acquirers and end users regarding AI risks.

2. Regularly update them on the status of residual risks, any changes in risk mitigation strategies, and any new risk identifications.

3. Encourage feedback from downstream acquirers and end users to improve the risk management process and address their concerns.

### Manage 1.4.5. Continuously Monitor and Review Residual Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly monitor the status of residual risks and assess their potential impact on downstream acquirers and end users.

2. Evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and adapt them as needed based on new information, emerging risks, or changes in circumstances.

3. Maintain documentation of all changes to residual risks and the rationale behind the decisions.

### Manage 1.4.6. Foster a Culture of Risk Awareness and Transparency.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture of risk awareness and transparency throughout the AI development and deployment lifecycle.

2. Educate AI developers, operators, downstream acquirers, and end users about AI risks, risk management principles, and their roles in mitigating risks.

3. Integrate risk management into organizational policies, procedures, and training programs to ensure ongoing risk awareness and accountability.
