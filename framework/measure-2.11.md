## Measure 2.11: Fairness and bias – as identified in the map function – are evaluated and results are documented.

### Measure 2.11.1. Identify and Assess Fairness and Bias Concerns.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify potential fairness and bias concerns in the AI system, considering factors such as data representation, algorithmic design, and decision-making processes.

2. Evaluate the AI system's ability to treat all individuals and groups fairly, without discrimination or prejudice.

3. Assess the potential for unintended consequences or disparate impacts due to the AI system's biased behavior.

### Measure 2.11.2. Assess Impacts of Fairness and Bias Concerns.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the potential impacts of fairness and bias concerns on various stakeholders, including individuals who interact with the AI system, the organization responsible for the AI system, and society as a whole.

2. Consider the potential for harm, discrimination, or social unrest due to unfair or biased AI decisions.

3. Evaluate the implications for trust, user engagement, and compliance with ethical principles.

### Measure 2.11.3. Develop Fairness and Bias Mitigation Strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement strategies to mitigate fairness and bias concerns, addressing identified issues and promoting equitable outcomes.

2. Consider employing fairness-aware algorithms, data augmentation techniques, and human oversight mechanisms to enhance fairness.

3. Establish clear procedures for auditing and identifying biased patterns in AI decision-making.

### Measure 2.11.4. Establish Fairness and Bias Reporting Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement regular reporting mechanisms to track the progress of fairness and bias mitigation efforts, identify emerging concerns, and communicate with stakeholders.

2. Report on the AI system's fairness and bias risk management practices to relevant stakeholders, including users, regulators, and ethical oversight bodies.

3. Disseminate fairness and bias reports to promote transparency, foster trust, and demonstrate responsible AI practices.

### Measure 2.11.5. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Fairness and Bias Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of fairness and bias mitigation strategies, identifying areas for improvement and adapting measures as the AI system evolves.

2. Gather feedback from internal and external stakeholders to refine fairness and bias risk management practices.

3. Stay informed about emerging best practices and technological advancements in fairness and bias mitigation for AI systems.

### Measure 2.11.6. Document Fairness and Bias Concerns and Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain a comprehensive record of fairness and bias concerns, mitigation strategies, and evaluation findings.

2. Document the rationale behind risk identification, mitigation choices, and decision-making processes.

3. Share fairness and bias documentation with relevant stakeholders to promote transparency and accountability throughout the organization.

### Measure 2.11.7. Promote Fairness and Bias Culture.

#### Sub Practices

1. Foster a culture of fairness awareness and responsibility throughout the AI development lifecycle, prioritizing ethical AI practices and promoting equitable outcomes.

2. Educate and train AI developers, operators, and decision-makers on fairness principles, best practices, and tools for identifying and mitigating bias.

3. Integrate fairness considerations into organizational policies, procedures, and governance frameworks.
