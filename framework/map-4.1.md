# Map 4: Risks and benefits are mapped for all components of the AI system including third-party software and data.

## Map 4.1: Approaches for mapping AI technology and legal risks of its components – including the use of third-party data or software – are in place, followed, and documented, as are risks of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property or other rights.

### Map 4.1.1. Identify and Assess Legal Risks Associated with AI Technology.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of potential legal risks associated with the AI system, including intellectual property (IP) infringement, data privacy violations, and algorithmic bias.

2. Consider the use of third-party data, software, or models, and evaluate the legal implications of these relationships.

3. Assess regulatory requirements and compliance obligations related to the AI system's functionality and deployment.

### Map 4.1.2. Document Legal Risk Assessment Findings.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the identified legal risks, their potential impact, and the rationale behind the assessment.

2. Identify the specific components of the AI system that pose legal risks, such as the AI algorithms, data sources, or software libraries.

3. Provide justification for any assumptions or conclusions made during the legal risk assessment process.

### Map 4.1.3. Develop Mitigation Strategies for Legal Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement proactive mitigation strategies to address the identified legal risks.

2. Implement measures to protect IP rights, ensure data privacy compliance, and minimize algorithmic bias.

3. Establish procedures for managing and resolving potential legal disputes arising from AI system usage.

### Map 4.1.4. Integrate Legal Risk Management into Development Process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate legal risk management into the AI system's development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to deployment and ongoing operations.

2. Conduct legal reviews of AI system specifications, contracts, and documentation to ensure compliance with legal requirements.

3. Establish a mechanism for ongoing legal risk monitoring and adaptation as the AI system evolves and new risks emerge.

### Map 4.1.5. Seek Legal Expertise and Compliance Guidance.

#### Sub Practices

1. Consult with legal counsel specializing in AI and data privacy laws to gain expert advice on legal risks and compliance obligations.

2. Engage legal counsel in the development of mitigation strategies and the drafting of contracts and agreements related to AI system development and deployment.

3. Maintain ongoing communication with legal counsel to ensure continuous compliance with evolving legal requirements.
