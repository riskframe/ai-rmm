## Manage 1.2: Treatment of documented AI risks is prioritized based on impact, likelihood, and available resources or methods.

### Manage 1.2.1. Prioritize Risks Based on Impact and Likelihood.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the potential impact of each identified AI risk on various stakeholders, including individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.

2. Evaluate the likelihood of each risk occurring based on factors such as the AI system's design, implementation, and operational environment.

3. Utilize risk assessment matrices or tools to quantify the severity and likelihood of risks, providing a clear indication of their overall risk profile.

### Manage 1.2.2. Categorize and Group Similar Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Group AI risks based on their shared characteristics, such as the type of risk, the affected stakeholder, or the underlying cause.

2. Categorize risks into high, medium, and low tiers based on their aggregated impact and likelihood scores.

3. Identify and prioritize the most critical risks that pose the greatest potential threats to the AI system's trustworthiness and its impact on stakeholders.

### Manage 1.2.3. Assess Resource Availability and Constraints.

#### Sub Practices

1. Evaluate the resources available for addressing AI risks, including personnel, financial resources, and technical capabilities.

2. Identify any constraints or limitations that may hinder the implementation of risk mitigation strategies.

3. Consider the feasibility and effectiveness of potential mitigation measures given the available resources and constraints.

### Manage 1.2.4. Develop Risk Mitigation Strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. For each prioritized AI risk, develop tailored mitigation strategies that aim to reduce or eliminate the risk's potential impact.

2. Consider a range of mitigation options, such as system redesign, process improvements, or additional controls.

3. Prioritize mitigation strategies based on their effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-benefit analysis.

### Manage 1.2.5. Implement Risk Mitigation Plans.

#### Sub Practices

1. Translate mitigation strategies into actionable plans that outline specific actions, timelines, and responsible parties.

2. Allocate resources and assign responsibilities for implementing the risk mitigation plans.

3. Establish clear communication channels to keep stakeholders informed of progress and any challenges encountered.

### Manage 1.2.6. Monitor and Evaluate Risk Mitigation Effectiveness.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly monitor the implementation of risk mitigation plans and assess their effectiveness in addressing identified risks.

2. Collect data on the impact of mitigation measures and track changes in risk levels.

3. Adapt risk mitigation strategies as needed based on new information, emerging risks, or changing circumstances.

### Manage 1.2.7. Foster a Culture of Risk Awareness and Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Promote a culture of risk awareness and responsibility throughout the AI development lifecycle.

2. Educate AI developers, operators, and decision-makers on risk identification, assessment, prioritization, and mitigation strategies.

3. Integrate risk management principles into organizational policies, procedures, and training programs.
