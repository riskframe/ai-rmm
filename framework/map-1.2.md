## Map 1.2: Interdisciplinary AI actors, competencies, skills, and capacities for establishing context reflect demographic diversity and broad domain and user experience expertise, and their participation is documented. Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration are prioritized.

### Map 1.2.1. Foster a Culture of Inclusiveness and Diversity.

#### Sub Practices

1. Actively seek out and recruit AI actors from diverse demographic backgrounds, including gender, race, ethnicity, cultural background, and age.

2. Cultivate an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are valued, respected, and integrated into the AI development process.

3. Provide training and awareness programs to address unconscious bias and promote inclusive practices.

### Map 1.2.2. Identify and Engage Interdisciplinary AI Actors.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify and engage a diverse team of AI actors, including experts in computer science, engineering, data science, domain expertise, user experience (UX), law, ethics, and social sciences.

2. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team member, ensuring that their expertise is effectively utilized throughout the AI lifecycle.

3. Foster interdisciplinary collaboration by creating opportunities for team members to learn from each other's perspectives and expertise.

### Map 1.2.3. Document Competencies, Skills, and Context-Establishing Capacities.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create a comprehensive profile for each AI actor, documenting their competencies, skills, and experience in relevant areas, including domain knowledge, AI technologies, UX design principles, and ethical considerations.

2. Prioritize the involvement of AI actors with deep domain expertise and strong understanding of the context in which the AI system will be deployed.

3. Document the context-establishing capacities of each AI actor, including their ability to identify and understand the social, cultural, and ethical implications of the AI system.

### Map 1.2.4. Prioritize Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Collaboration.

#### Sub Practices

1. Establish a structured approach to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, such as regular team meetings, brainstorming sessions, and joint work activities.

2. Facilitate knowledge sharing and cross-training among AI actors from different disciplines.

3. Encourage open communication and feedback mechanisms to promote an inclusive and collaborative environment.

### Map 1.2.5. Continuously Evaluate and Enhance Interdisciplinary Collaboration.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly assess the effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration practices and identify areas for improvement.

2. Gather feedback from AI actors on their experiences and suggestions for enhancing collaboration.

3. Adapt collaboration strategies based on feedback and evolving needs throughout the AI lifecycle.
