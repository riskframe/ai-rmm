# Measure 2: AI systems are evaluated for trustworthy characteristics.

## Measure 2.1: Test sets, metrics, and details about the tools used during Test & Evaluation, Validation & Verification (TEVV) are documented.

### Measure 2.1.1. Develop and Document Test Sets.

Creating and maintaining comprehensive records of test datasets is crucial for ensuring the reliability and integrity of AI systems. This involves not only the meticulous compilation of the data used in testing but also detailed annotations and metadata that describe the dataset's characteristics, sources, and any preprocessing steps undertaken. Such documentation facilitates transparency and reproducibility, allowing for more effective debugging and refinement of AI models, as well as enabling peer review and validation by the broader community.

Incorporating a variety of scenarios, inputs, and potential errors into comprehensive test sets is essential to evaluate the AI system's functionality, performance, and trustworthiness. Tailoring these test sets to the specific AI system and its application domain is crucial, taking into account potential biases, ethical considerations, and the impact on communities involved. Additionally, thorough documentation of the reasons behind the chosen test cases, the rationale for excluding particular scenarios, and the overarching strategy for test coverage is vital to ensure transparency and accountability in the system's evaluation process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create comprehensive test sets that encompass a wide range of scenarios, inputs, and potential errors, covering the AI system's functionality, performance, and trustworthiness characteristics.

2. Ensure that test sets are tailored to the specific AI system and its application domain, considering potential biases, ethical implications, and potential impacts on affected communities.

3. Document the rationale behind the selection of test cases, justifications for excluding certain scenarios, and the overall test coverage strategy.

### Measure 2.1.2. Establish Clear Test Metrics.

Setting precise and relevant metrics for testing is crucial in assessing the performance and reliability of AI systems. These metrics should not only reflect the system's ability to perform its intended tasks but also encompass measures of fairness, transparency, and ethical considerations. By clearly defining these metrics, stakeholders can better understand the system's capabilities and limitations, facilitating a more informed decision-making process. Additionally, clear metrics support the establishment of benchmarks for future improvements and comparisons, enhancing the overall trustworthiness of AI technologies.

Defining both quantitative and qualitative metrics plays a pivotal role in assessing the effectiveness of testing activities, as well as in evaluating the AI system's performance and trustworthiness. It's essential to choose metrics that are not only relevant and measurable but also closely aligned with the identified AI risks, trustworthiness characteristics, and the overarching goals of the organization. Furthermore, thorough documentation of the reasons behind the selection of specific metrics is crucial, ensuring that they adequately represent the intended facets of the AI system's evaluation, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the system's capabilities and areas for improvement.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess the effectiveness of testing activities and evaluate the AI system's performance and trustworthiness.

### Measure 2.1.3. Identify and Document Testing Tools.

Recognizing and meticulously recording the tools employed in the testing process is a fundamental aspect of validating AI systems' trustworthiness. This involves detailing the software, frameworks, and methodologies used during Test & Evaluation, Validation & Verification (TEVV) phases. Such comprehensive documentation not only ensures transparency and reproducibility but also aids in understanding the system's evaluation under various conditions. Moreover, it allows for the scrutiny and verification of the tools' suitability and effectiveness in assessing the AI system's performance, thereby contributing to the overall reliability of the evaluation process.

This practice involves evaluating tool capabilities, ensuring compatibility with the AI system's architecture and testing needs. Documenting the selection criteria, focusing on tool features and alignment with organizational standards, is essential for a transparent and effective testing process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify and select appropriate testing tools that can effectively automate test execution, analyze test results, and provide insights into the AI system's behavior and performance.

2. Evaluate the capabilities and limitations of testing tools, considering factors such as compatibility with the AI system's architecture, data format, and testing needs.

3. Document the selection criteria for testing tools, including their features, performance, and alignment with organizational standards.

### Measure 2.1.4. Establish Test Execution Procedures.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define detailed procedures for executing test sets, including data preparation, test case execution, and reporting of results.

2. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for test execution, ensuring that qualified individuals are responsible for conducting and documenting test results.

3. Document the test execution procedures, including the testing environment, configuration settings, and error handling mechanisms.

### Measure 2.1.5. Integrate Testing into Development Lifecycle.

Formulating detailed procedures for test execution is fundamental to ensuring the thorough and consistent evaluation of AI systems. This involves specifying the steps to be followed, the conditions under which tests are to be conducted, and the criteria for passing or failing the tests. Such well-defined procedures not only facilitate the systematic assessment of the system's functionality and performance but also enhance the reproducibility and reliability of the testing process. Moreover, clear guidelines help in identifying and addressing potential issues more efficiently, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of the AI system.

Incorporating testing activities from the onset of the AI system's development lifecycle is essential, positioning testing as a core component rather than a subsequent consideration. By scheduling regular testing cycles throughout the development stages, potential issues can be detected and rectified promptly, minimizing the likelihood of defects emerging later. Furthermore, integrating testing tools and procedures within the development environment supports automated testing and the adoption of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, streamlining the development and ensuring the AI system's robustness and reliability.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate testing activities into the AI system's development lifecycle, ensuring that testing is not an afterthought but an integral part of the development process.

2. Schedule regular testing cycles throughout the development process to identify and address potential issues early on, reducing the risk of introducing defects later in the lifecycle.

3. Integrate testing tools and procedures into the development environment, facilitating automated testing and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices.

### Measure 2.1.6. Document Testing Results and Insights.

Thoroughly recording the outcomes and insights gained from testing is critical for the continuous improvement and accountability of AI systems. This documentation should include not only the raw results but also an in-depth analysis that provides context and understanding of the system's performance under various conditions. Such comprehensive records support the identification of trends, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for enhancement. Moreover, this practice facilitates transparent communication with stakeholders, contributing to the trust and credibility of the AI system's evaluation process.

Maintaining a detailed log of all testing activities, from executed test cases to identified issues, is essential for a holistic understanding of the AI system's behavior. Analyzing these results to discern patterns and trends enables the identification of improvement opportunities. Documenting insights, including recommendations for boosting the system's performance, trustworthiness, and ethical compliance, is crucial for informed decision-making and continuous enhancement of the AI system.
