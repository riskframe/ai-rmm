## Map 3.3: Targeted application scope is specified and documented based on the systemâ€™s capability, established context, and AI system categorization.

### Map 3.3.1. Clearly Define AI System Capabilities.

#### Sub Practices

1. Thoroughly assess the AI system's capabilities, including its functional features, performance limitations, and limitations due to data availability or quality.

2. Identify the specific tasks, data types, and use cases that the AI system is designed to handle effectively.

3. Document the AI system's capabilities in a clear and concise manner, using a structured format that facilitates understanding and traceability.

### Map 3.3.2. Establish Clear Application Context.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define the specific context in which the AI system will be deployed, including the target users, organizational environment, and operational conditions.

2. Identify any potential factors that may affect the AI system's performance, such as data constraints, network limitations, or changes in user behavior.

3. Document the application context in a comprehensive manner, ensuring that it aligns with the AI system's capabilities and limitations.

### Map 3.3.3. Classify AI System Based on Risk Level.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the potential risks associated with the AI system based on its capabilities, application context, and potential impact on individuals, organizations, and society.

2. Use established AI system categorization frameworks to classify the AI system into appropriate risk tiers.

3. Document the AI system's risk classification and justify the assigned tier.

### Map 3.3.4. Specify Targeted Application Scope.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define the specific application scope of the AI system, outlining the boundaries within which the AI system will operate and the types of tasks it will be used for.

2. Clearly delineate between the intended and unintended uses of the AI system, ensuring that it is not deployed in situations where it cannot function safely or effectively.

3. Document the targeted application scope in a detailed manner, ensuring that it aligns with the AI system's capabilities, risk classification, and application context.

### Map 3.3.5. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Scope.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly review and evaluate the targeted application scope of the AI system as it evolves and new information becomes available.

2. Consider feedback from users, stakeholders, and regulators to refine the scope and ensure that it remains appropriate and aligned with the AI system's capabilities and risk profile.

3. Maintain a living document that reflects the evolving targeted application scope and serves as a reference for ongoing AI development and deployment decisions.
