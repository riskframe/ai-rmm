## Map 1.5: Organizational risk tolerances are determined and documented.

### Map 1.5.1. Establish an Organizational Risk Tolerance Framework.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop a comprehensive framework for defining, classifying, and managing organizational risk tolerances.

2. Identify the types of risks that are relevant to AI development and utilization, including technical, ethical, legal, and social risks.

3. Define acceptable levels of risk for each identified risk type based on the organization's risk appetite and risk profile.

### Map 1.5.2. Document Risk Tolerances and Their Justifications.

#### Sub Practices

1. Create a comprehensive document that clearly outlines the organization's risk tolerances for AI systems.

2. Provide justifications for each risk tolerance level, explaining the rationale behind the acceptable level of risk.

3. Ensure that risk tolerances are aligned with the organization's mission, goals, and values.

### Map 1.5.3. Involve Relevant Stakeholders in Risk Tolerance Definition.

#### Sub Practices

1. Engage a cross-functional team of stakeholders, including AI developers, business leaders, risk managers, legal counsel, and ethics experts, in defining risk tolerances.

2. Encourage open discussion and debate to ensure that risk tolerances reflect the perspectives and concerns of all relevant parties.

3. Document the involvement of stakeholders in the risk tolerance definition process.

### Map 1.5.4. Regularly Review and Update Risk Tolerances.

#### Sub Practices

1. Conduct periodic reviews of the organization's risk tolerances to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with evolving business needs, technological advancements, and societal changes.

2. Consider the impact of new AI technologies, potential risks associated with data handling, and evolving ethical considerations.

3. Adapt risk tolerances as needed to reflect the changing landscape of AI development and utilization.

### Map 1.5.5. Integrate Risk Tolerances into AI Development Process.

#### Sub Practices

1. Incorporate risk tolerances into the AI development process, ensuring that AI systems are designed, developed, and deployed within acceptable risk parameters.

2. Use risk tolerances to guide decision-making throughout the AI lifecycle, from project prioritization to system deployment and operation.
