## Govern 1.7: Processes and procedures are in place for decommissioning and phasing out AI systems safely and in a manner that does not increase risks or decrease the organizationâ€™s trustworthiness.

### Govern 1.7.1. Establish decommissioning and phasing-out policies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Define clear policies for decommissioning and phasing out AI systems, outlining the process, responsibilities, and procedures involved.

2. Ensure policies align with the organization's overall risk management framework and ethical principles.

3. Regularly review and update policies as AI technologies and decommissioning practices evolve.

### Govern 1.7.2. Identify AI systems for decommissioning or phasing out.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop criteria for identifying AI systems that are no longer needed or are reaching their end of life.

2. Consider factors such as system performance, obsolescence, business need, and potential risks associated with continued use.

3. Establish a process for evaluating and approving decommissioning or phasing-out proposals.

### Govern 1.7.3. Develop detailed decommissioning and phasing-out procedures.

#### Sub Practices

1. For each AI system identified for decommissioning or phasing out, create a detailed plan outlining the steps involved in the process.

2. Include procedures for data migration, model archiving, system shut-down, security measures, and communication with stakeholders.

3. Ensure procedures are documented, accessible to relevant personnel, and regularly reviewed and updated.

### Govern 1.7.4. Implement data migration and archiving.

#### Sub Practices

1. Carefully migrate data from AI systems to secure storage locations, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

2. Apply appropriate data anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to protect sensitive information.

3. Establish a process for archiving AI models and associated documentation for future reference or regulatory compliance.

### Govern 1.7.5. Address security concerns.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement robust security protocols to protect AI systems during decommissioning or phasing out.

2. Remove access privileges to systems and data, preventing unauthorized access or misuse.

3. Conduct thorough security audits and vulnerability assessments to ensure the integrity of decommissioned systems and data.

### Govern 1.7.6. Communicate with stakeholders.

#### Sub Practices

1. Proactively communicate decommissioning or phasing-out plans to relevant stakeholders, including employees, customers, regulators, and partners.

2. Explain the rationale behind the decision, potential impacts, and mitigation measures.

3. Establish clear channels for feedback and address concerns raised by stakeholders.

### Govern 1.7.7. Monitor and evaluate decommissioning.

#### Sub Practices

1. Continuously monitor the decommissioning process to ensure compliance with policies, procedures, and security measures.

2. Address any issues or challenges that arise during the decommissioning process.

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of decommissioning processes and make improvements as needed.
