## Measure 2.10: Privacy risk of the AI system – as identified in the map function – is examined and documented.

### Measure 2.10.1. Identify and Assess Privacy Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Identify potential privacy risks associated with the AI system, considering factors such as data collection, storage, processing, and usage.

2. Evaluate the AI system's data handling practices to identify potential breaches of privacy regulations and ethical principles.

3. Assess the potential for discrimination, profiling, or manipulation due to the AI system's access to personal data.

### Measure 2.10.2. Assess Impacts of Privacy Risks.

#### Sub Practices

1. Assess the potential impacts of privacy risks on various stakeholders, including individuals whose data is collected and used, the organization responsible for the AI system, and society as a whole.

2. Consider the potential for harm, discrimination, or reputational damage due to privacy breaches or misuse of personal data.

3. Evaluate the implications for trust, user engagement, and compliance with data privacy regulations.

### Measure 2.10.3. Develop Privacy Risk Mitigation Strategies.

#### Sub Practices

1. Develop and implement strategies to mitigate privacy risks, addressing identified concerns and protecting individuals' personal data.

2. Consider implementing data minimization principles, pseudonymization techniques, and anonymization procedures to enhance data privacy.

3. Establish clear procedures for data access, security, and disposal to safeguard personal information.

### Measure 2.10.4. Establish Privacy Risk Reporting Mechanisms.

#### Sub Practices

1. Implement regular reporting mechanisms to track the progress of privacy risk mitigation efforts, identify emerging concerns, and communicate with stakeholders.

2. Report on the AI system's privacy risk management practices to relevant stakeholders, including users, regulators, and data privacy oversight bodies.

3. Disseminate privacy risk reports to promote transparency, foster trust, and demonstrate responsible AI practices.

### Measure 2.10.5. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt Privacy Risk Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of privacy risk mitigation strategies, identifying areas for improvement and adapting measures as the AI system evolves.

2. Gather feedback from internal and external stakeholders to refine privacy risk management practices.

3. Stay informed about emerging best practices and technological advancements in privacy risk management for AI systems.

### Measure 2.10.6. Document Privacy Risks and Mitigation.

#### Sub Practices

1. Maintain a comprehensive record of privacy risks, mitigation strategies, and evaluation findings.

2. Document the rationale behind risk identification, mitigation choices, and decision-making processes.

3. Share privacy risk documentation with relevant stakeholders to promote transparency and accountability throughout the organization.

### Measure 2.10.7. Promote Privacy Culture.

#### Sub Practices

1. Foster a culture of privacy awareness and responsibility throughout the AI development lifecycle, promoting the protection of personal data and ethical data handling practices.

2. Educate and train AI developers, operators, and decision-makers on privacy principles, regulations, and best practices.

3. Integrate privacy considerations into organizational policies, procedures, and governance frameworks.
