# Artificial Intelligence Resilience Maturity Model (AI-RMM/AIRMM/AI RMM) - README

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Artificial Intelligence Resilience Maturity Model (AI-RMM), also referred to as AIRMM, AI-RMM, or simply as the "Model". The AI-RMM is a conceptual framework used to assess, measure, and improve the resilience of organizations using or planning to use Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Model examines how organizations are set up with respect to their AI systems and is structured as a series of levels or stages that represent different degrees of resilience maturity. This repository provides the framework definitions of AI-RMM, to help enhance the resilience maturity of organizations using artificial systems.
