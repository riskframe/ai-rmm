# SOURCE CODE DEFINITION for the Artificial Intelligence Resilience Maturity Model (AI-RMM/AIRMM/AI RMM)

## INTRODUCTION:
The concept of "source code" in software development typically refers to the human-readable instructions that a programmer writes. However, in the context of the Artificial Intelligence Resilience Maturity Model (AI-RMM/AIRMM/AI RMM), which primarily deals with documentation rather than traditional software code, it's important to clarify what we consider as "source code". This clarification ensures that our community understands how to interact with, modify, and distribute the contents of this repository in a manner consistent with the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL v3.0).

## DEFINITION OF "SOURCE CODE":
For the purposes of this repository, "source code" refers to the preferred form of the material for making modifications to it. This includes:

1. Markdown Files (.md):
   - Textual documentation, guides, and descriptions are provided in Markdown format.
   - "Source code" for these documents includes the original Markdown files (.md) that can be edited with any plain text editor.

2. Source Files for PDFs:
   - For PDF documents provided in this repository, "source code" refers to the original editable files from which these PDFs are generated.
   - This may include LaTeX source files (.tex), Word documents (.docx), or other formats that are used to create the PDFs.

3. Excel Files (.xlsx) and Other Spreadsheet Formats:
   - Spreadsheets are used for data models, calculations, or structured data related to the AI RMM.
   - The "source code" for these documents includes the original spreadsheet files (.xlsx, .ods, etc.) that can be edited with spreadsheet software.

## GUIDELINES FOR WORKING WITH "SOURCE CODE":
1. Making Modifications:
   - When modifying any "source code" within this repository, strive to ensure that your changes are clear, well-documented, and easy for others to understand.
   - Include comments or notes within your files to explain significant changes, methodologies, or data sources, as applicable.

2. Sharing Modifications:
   - In line with GPL v3.0 requirements, any modifications or derived works based on the "source code" in this repository must also be made available under the same GPL v3.0 license.
   - When distributing modified versions of the "source code", include a summary of the changes made and provide access to the modified source files.

3. Documenting Changes:
   - Maintain a changelog or a similar record within your documents or as a separate file to track the history of modifications.
   - This documentation should include dates, a brief description of changes, and the names or identifiers of contributors.

By providing this clarification and these guidelines, we aim to foster an open, collaborative environment where modifications and improvements to the AI RMM documentation are made transparently and in a manner consistent with the principles of open-source development.

Thank you for contributing to the Artificial Intelligence Resilience Maturity Model.
